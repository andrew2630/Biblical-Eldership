---

### **Three Key Features of a Biblical Eldership**

---

#### **A. Pastoral Leadership by Elders**
##### 1. Central Tenet
- Eldership is **inherently pastoral** in nature
- Rooted in apostolic teaching and modeled after Christ

##### 2. Apostolic Instruction
- **Paul to Ephesian Elders** (Acts 20:28, CSB)
   - a. *“Be on guard… overseers… to shepherd the church of God…”*
   - b. The Holy Spirit places elders in the flock for **pastoral care**
   - c. The flock is purchased with Christ’s own blood
- **Peter to Elders in Asia Minor** (1 Pet. 5:1–2)
   - a. *“Shepherd the flock of God that is among you…”*
   - b. Elders exercise oversight
   - c. Elders are **uniquely charged** with shepherding—no other group shares this mandate

##### 3. Pastoral Responsibility Defined
- Elders are assigned **pastoral oversight** of specific, individual flocks
- Supported in their work by **qualified deacons**
   - a. See: Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 3:8–13
   - b. Explored further in Chapter 11

##### 4. Nature of Shepherd Leadership
- Contrasted with corporate/business leadership models
- Encompasses:
   - a. Teaching Scripture
   - b. Protecting from false teachers
   - c. Evangelizing
   - d. Counseling
   - e. Caring for practical needs
   - f. Living among the flock as **Christlike examples**

##### 5. Character of Shepherd Leadership
- Blends:
   - a. **Authority** and **leadership**
   - b. **Self-sacrifice**, **tenderness**, **intimacy**
- Follows the pattern of the **Good Shepherd** (John 10:11)
   - a. *“The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.”*

##### 6. Supporting Testimony
- **Timothy Witmer** (*The Shepherd Leader*)
   - a. *“Shepherding is at the very heart of the biblical picture of leadership.”*

---

#### **B. Shared Leadership by Elders (Plurality)**
##### 1. Biblical Foundations
- Not a new idea—**Old Testament** Israel governed by plural leadership
- NT follows a similar principle consistently

##### 2. Example of Jesus
- Jesus did **not** appoint a singular human leader
- He trained and commissioned **twelve apostles**
   - a. All equally apostles
   - b. No “senior apostle with assistants”
   - c. Apostolic leadership was **shared and collaborative**
   - d. This is the model given to the church

##### 3. Example of the Apostles
- Elders in early churches functioned as **collective councils**
- Pastoral oversight given to multiple elders per church
- **Paul’s example**:
   - a. At beginning and end of ministry
   - b. Appointed/commanded appointment of **qualified elder teams**
     - i. Acts 14:23
     - ii. Titus 1:5
- Plurality of elders = **consistent New Testament pattern**

##### 4. Theological Affirmation
- **John Murray** (Westminster Theological Seminary):
   - a. *“Plurality is written in the boldest letters in the pages of the New Testament...”*
   - b. *“Singularity bears the hallmark of despite to Christ’s institution.”*
   - → **One-man rule = contradiction of NT design**

##### 5. Equality and Functional Diversity
- All elders:
   - a. Share same **office**, **title**, **pastoral charge**
- At the same time:
   - a. Differ in **Spirit-giftedness**
   - b. **Life experience**
   - c. **Availability**
   - d. **Verbal/teaching abilities**
   - e. **Biblical knowledge**

###### a. Scriptural Support for Diversity without Hierarchy
- **1 Tim. 5:17–18**
   - i. *“Elders who rule well…”*
   - ii. *“…especially those who labor in preaching and teaching”*
   - iii. *“Double honor” = financial support and esteem*
- This creates **functional diversity**, not a formal hierarchy

###### b. Practical Implications
- Some elders serve part-time, others full-time
- Model seen also in the apostolic circle:
   - i. Peter, James, John stand out in leadership
   - ii. Yet all twelve equally apostles

###### c. Further Development
- Full exposition of parity/diversity in **Chapter 3**

---

#### **C. Qualified Leadership by Elders**
##### 1. Absolute Scriptural Requirement
- Elders must be **biblically qualified**
- This is **non-negotiable** in NT teaching
- **More space is given to qualifications** than to any other eldership topic

- To establish the **biblical superiority and textual support** of biblical eldership

#### **B. Overview of Five Major Views of Church Government**
> Source: *Perspectives on Church Government: Five Views of Church Polity*, ed. Chad O. Brand & R. Stanton Norman

##### 1. **Single-Elder-Led Church**
- **Polity**: Congregational
- One elder leads the congregation
- Emphasis on **local church autonomy**

##### 2. **Presbytery-Led Church**
- **Polity**: Presbyterian
- Authority lies with a **regional body of elders** (presbytery)
- Local church submits to **broader ecclesiastical courts**

##### 3. **Congregation-Led Church**
- **Polity**: Congregational
- **Final authority rests with the members**
- Elders/pastors may lead, but decisions are **congregation-driven**

##### 4. **Bishop-Led Church**
- **Polity**: Episcopal or Anglican
- Authority concentrated in **bishops**
- Hierarchical structure: bishop → priest → deacon

##### 5. **Plural-Elder-Led Church**
- **Polity**: Biblical eldership
- Leadership by **a team of scripturally qualified elders**
- View taught and defended in *Biblical Eldership*
- **Least known/practiced**, often rejected as radical
- Yet **most deeply embedded** in the language and theology of Scripture

---

#### **C. Scriptural Foundation of Plural-Elder-Led Church**
##### 1. Unique Biblical Grounding
- *No other polity* receives as much direct scriptural support
- **Eight core didactic passages** form the backbone of NT eldership doctrine:

###### a. The Eight Central Didactic Texts
1. **Acts 14:23** – Appointment of elders in every church
2. **Acts 20:17–38** – Paul's final charge to the Ephesian elders
3. **Philippians 1:1** – Addressed to overseers and deacons
4. **1 Timothy 3:1–7** – Qualifications for elders
5. **1 Timothy 5:17–25** – Honor, accusations, discipline of elders
6. **Titus 1:5–9** – Elders’ appointment and qualifications
7. **James 5:14–15** – Call the elders to pray for the sick
8. **1 Peter 5:1–5** – Shepherding and conduct of elders

##### 2. Proper Hermeneutical Principle
- Clear, central, didactic texts take precedence over unclear or obscure ones
- These eight texts = **clear and central**
- Must form the **starting point** for a doctrine of church government

---

#### **D. Theological Resistance and Institutional Rejection**
##### 1. Personal Testimony from the Author
- Experience in **seminary** revealed institutional bias:
   - a. Elder-led church idea **mocked**, called impractical
   - b. **Professors rejected** the value of numerous Scripture texts on elders
   - c. Author’s seminary professor:
     - i. “Having numerous texts on eldership means nothing!”
   - d. Implied contrast: reliance on **tradition over text**

##### 2. Widespread Hermeneutical Failure
- **Abandonment of basic interpretive principles**:
   - a. Priority of clear, didactic texts
   - b. Elevation of **secondary**, **unclear** passages
- Result:
   - a. **Biblical eldership is ignored** or
   - b. **Reinterpreted to fit denominational structures**

---

#### **E. Doctrinal and Practical Implications**
##### 1. Author’s Growing Conviction
- Opposition confirmed the **validity and urgency** of biblical eldership
- Most churches:
   - a. **Ignore**, **misapply**, or **reinterpret** eldership
   - b. Follow **tradition**, not text

##### 2. Goal of the Book
- To help the church **recover and obey** the biblical pattern
- Leadership by a **body of scripturally qualified, Spirit-appointed elders**

##### 3. Supporting Summary – **Albert N. Martin**
- *“The normal biblical framework of oversight is a plurality of scripturally qualified overseers laboring together with genuine parity and realistic, harmonious, functional diversity.”*

---

#### **F. God’s Glory in Biblical Restoration**
- God is honored when:
   - a. His people **recover long-disregarded truths**
   - b. They **renew obedience** to Scripture
   - c. They reject **cultural or institutional inertia** in favor of biblical design

---

#### **G. Transition to Jesus’s Model of Leadership**
> Before continuing the study of eldership, attention must be given to the **unique leadership teachings of Jesus Christ**

##### 1. Core Leadership Virtues Taught by Jesus
- **Humility**
- **Servanthood**
- **Brotherly equality**
- **Christlike love**

##### 2. Description
- Commonly referred to as: **“Servant Leadership”**

##### 3. Relevance
- Forms the **foundation** for understanding:
   - a. Christian leadership
   - b. How elders are to function as a team
- Serves as the **next subject** of exploration in the book

## **RESTORING NEW TESTAMENT ELDERSHIP**

---

### *Chapter 1* | New Principles for Leadership

#### _
- John 13:14–15 – “If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet…”
- The Gospels present Jesus as:
  - Perfectly perfect
    - Sinless
    - Without flaw or blemish
    - Perfectly obedient
  - Jesus as the only perfect teacher:
  - Titled “Faithful and True” and “The Word of God” (Rev. 19:11, 13)
    - Matt. 23:8, 10 – “You have one teacher… one instructor, the Christ”
    - Matt. 28:19–20 – Disciples commanded to teach only what Jesus taught
  - People’s reaction to Jesus’s teaching:
  - Mark 1:27 – “A new teaching with authority!”
    - Matt. 9:17 – New wine into fresh wineskins
  - Revolutionary teachings on leadership:
  - Inverted pyramid: leaders serve those below
    - Leadership entails:
      - Humility
        - Servanthood
        - Brotherhood
        - Christlike love
    - Jesus:
  - Denounced religious teachers’ abuse of authority
    - Prohibited authoritarianism: “Not so with you” (Luke 22:26)
    - Gave example of plurality leadership via the Twelve

#### The Training of the Twelve
- Jesus deliberately trained a **team** of twelve
- A. B. Bruce, _The Training of the Twelve_:
  - Training the twelve was of “supreme importance”
    - Principal part of Jesus’s ministry
    - Ensured permanent influence of Christ’s teaching
  - Not one ruler, but a **plurality**
  - Joint leadership
    - Trained in principles of brotherly cooperation

#### Transforming the Hearts and Minds of the Disciples
- Disciples unprepared at time of Jesus’s departure
  - Selfish values
    - Wrong view of God’s kingdom
    - Desired power and prestige
  - Examples:
  - Argued over “greatest” (Luke 22:24)
    - Sought thrones beside Jesus
  - Jesus’s mission: transform their mindset
  - Redefined greatness and leadership
    - Essential for functioning as a team
    - Dependent on:
      - New principles
        - Power of the Holy Spirit
    - Foundation for all elder teaching:
  - Humility
    - Servanthood
    - Brotherly equality
    - Christlike love

#### 1. Humility
- Jesus’s self-description:
  - “Gentle and lowly in heart” (Matt. 11:28–30)
  - Contrast with religious leaders:
  - Prideful
    - Abusive
    - Oppressive
  - Evidence of humility:
  - Attracted all types of people
    - Children and women felt safe
    - Associated with outcasts
    - Compassionate and approachable
  - Clarification:
  - Humility ≠ weakness
    - Jesus was strong, courageous, intellectually powerful
    - True greatness = balance of strength and humility
  - Taught followers to emulate humility

##### Who Is First and Greatest? (Mark 9:33–37)
- Context:
  - Argument followed Passion prediction
  - Mark 9:35 – “If anyone would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all”
- Use of paradox:
  - Challenge to common values
    - True greatness = service, humility, self-effacement
    - Receiving a child = receiving Christ and the Father

##### Fighting for First Place (Mark 10:32–45)
- James and John request top positions (v. 37)
- Jesus contrasts their desire with his mission:
  - He must suffer and die
    - Not give thrones, but predict suffering (v. 39)
    - “The cup… you will drink…” = persecution
  - Paradox of leadership:
  - Suffering precedes glory
    - Cross before crown
    - Serving before reigning
  - Mark 10:45 – “Son of Man came not to be served but to serve…”
  - Ultimate expression of servant-leadership

#### 2. Humble Servanthood
- Jesus washes disciples’ feet (John 13:3–5, 12–15)
  - Role reversal – Teacher and Lord becomes servant
  - Message:
  - Leaders must serve
    - Mutual care replaces power-seeking
  - Shocking cultural inversion
- Symbolism:
  - Servant’s towel over cleric’s robe
    - Basin and towel over throne
    - John Stott: true Christian leadership symbol = apron, not robe
  - John 13:17 – “Blessed are you if you do them”

##### Do Not Be Like Worldly Rulers (Luke 22:24–27)
- Another dispute over greatness
- Jesus’s rebuke:
  - “But not so with you”
    - Leader = youngest
    - Leader = servant
  - Jesus the table servant (v. 27)
  - Chose servant role voluntarily
    - Highest authority models lowest service

#### 3. Brotherly Equality
- Jesus condemns religious pride (Matt. 23:1–33)
- Issues with religious elite:
  - Greed
    - Hypocrisy
    - Status-seeking
    - Exploitation
  - Jesus’s warning (Matt. 23:1–12):
  - Avoid honorific titles
    - “You have one teacher… you are all brothers”
    - No hierarchical separation
    - True greatness = service
    - “Whoever exalts himself will be humbled…”

#### 4. Christlike Love
- John 13:34–35 – “Love one another: just as I have loved you”
- New commandment = new standard of love
  - Selfless
    - Sacrificial
    - Cross-centered
  - Warfield: “Self-sacrificing love is… the essence of the Christian life”
- Without this love:
  - Division
    - Denominationalism
    - Power struggles
  - Love necessary for unity and leadership:
  - 1 John 3:16
    - 1 Cor. 13:4–7
    - 1 Cor. 16:14 – “Let all that you do be done in love”

#### The Strongman Model of Leadership vs. The Christlike Servant Model

##### The Strongman Model
- Widespread globally
- Traits:
  - Power-hungry
    - Self-promoting
    - Manipulative
    - Dictatorial
    - Rejects shared leadership
  - Appeal:
  - People admire power
    - Desire “anointed” authoritarian leaders
  - Example: Diotrephes (3 John 9–10)
  - Self-first
    - Rejects apostolic authority
    - Spreads slander
    - Excludes others from church
    - Violates all servant-leadership principles

##### What the People Want
- Strongman popularity
  - Corinthian example (2 Cor. 11:19–21)
    - Preference for “super apostles”
    - Rejection of Paul’s humility
    - Misunderstanding of servant-leadership

#### Summary of the Servant-Leadership Model
- Doesn’t eliminate strong leadership
- Paul: lead “with zeal” (Rom. 12:8)
- Jesus taught:
  - New definitions of greatness, leadership, and life in community
    - Others-oriented leadership
    - Leadership = humble service
    - Serving insignificant ones
    - Willingness to suffer for others
    - Self-denial
    - Leading by example
    - Promoting others’ gifts
    - Brotherhood over hierarchy
    - 2 Cor. 4:5 – “Your servants for Jesus’ sake”

#### Looking Ahead
- Jesus’s teachings foundational to:
  - NT ecclesiology
    - Apostolic leadership structure
  - Biblical eldership = founded on:
  - Humility
    - Servanthood
    - Brotherly equality
    - Christlike love

---

### *Chapter 2* | Pastoral Leadership

#### _
- Acts 20:28 (CSB) – “The Holy Spirit has appointed you [elders] as overseers, to shepherd the church of God.”
- NT answer to who pastors the church: **elders**
  - Not deacons, not staff
    - All elders, not just one “head elder”
    - Elders = Spirit-appointed, scripturally qualified overseers
  - Importance of aligning church structure with:
  - Apostolic tasks (ch. 2)
    - Biblical qualifications (ch. 4)
  - 2 Tim. 3:16–17 – God-breathed writings as guide

#### Shepherd Imagery
- Psalm 23:1 – “The Lord is my Shepherd”
- John 10:11 – Jesus = “the good shepherd”
- Used by Paul and Peter when addressing elders
- Shepherd model (Derek Tidball, *Skillful Shepherds*):
  - Intimacy
    - Tenderness
    - Concern
    - Skill
    - Hard work
    - Suffering
    - Love
    - “A subtle blend of authority and care”
    - “As much toughness as tenderness, as much courage as comfort”

#### Shepherding Work

##### The Shepherd’s Presence
- Highly relational model
- John 10:5, 27 – sheep know shepherd’s voice; shepherd knows names
- Jeramie Rinne – “he even smells like sheep”
- Pastors must be visible and relational
  - Greet people
    - Learn names
    - Engage with all age groups
    - Be joyful
  - 1 Pet. 5:3 – “examples to the flock”
- Example = spiritual influence

##### Love
- Must love the sheep
  - Quote from Spanish shepherd: “You must love sheep.”
  - 1 Cor. 13:1–3 – Without love = nothing
- John 13:34 – “new commandment”
- Christlike love = essential for shepherding
- Love brings:
  - Joy in shepherding
    - Meaningful ministry
    - Warmth that covers lack of charisma

##### Authority
- Shepherd has rightful authority
- Shepherd-sheep model includes:
  - Leadership
    - Correction
    - Sovereignty
    - Yielding
  - Acts 20:28 – Holy Spirit appoints
  - Brings authority and empowerment
  - Authority always blended with care

##### Hard Work
- Gen. 31:40 – Shepherding = hard labor
- Ezek. 34:2–8 – Lazy shepherd = bad shepherd
- View of eldership:
  - Not status/board role
    - Pastoral labor

##### Sacrifice
- Eldership = constant concern for people
- Personal sacrifices:
  - Time
    - Energy
    - Emotional burden

##### Dangerous Work
- Protection from:
  - Beasts
    - Thieves
  - 1 Sam. 17:34–37 – David example
- In some countries, shepherding = life-threatening

##### Skill and Knowledge
- Shepherding requires:
  - Land/water management
    - Feeding care
    - Disease treatment
    - Birthing assistance
    - Shearing
    - Comforting the dying
  - Timothy Laniak, *Shepherds after My Own Heart*:
  - “Determined daily by the changing needs of the flock”
    - Pastors = generalists

##### Submit to and Obey
- Heb. 13:17 – “Obey your leaders and submit to them…”
- Elders are to:
  - Lead by example
    - Not lord over (1 Pet. 5:3)
  - Members = brothers and sisters, not subordinates

#### The Four-Fold Responsibility of Shepherd Elders

##### 1. Teaching–Feeding
- 1 Pet. 5:2; Acts 20:28 – Shepherd the flock/church of God
- Community identity:
  - Worshiping
    - Praying
    - Sharing bread and cup
    - Burden-bearing
    - Loving
    - Gift-exercising
    - Scripture-learning
    - Encouraging
    - Resisting sin and falsehood
  - Elders expected to:
  - Teach sound doctrine (Titus 1:9)
    - Rebuke error
    - Be “able to teach” (1 Tim. 3:2)
  - 1 Tim. 5:17–18 – Double honor to those who “labor” in teaching
- “Labor” = intensive study, prep, delivery
- Preaching = intellectual and spiritual labor
- Teaching Strategy:
  - Eph. 4:12 – Equip saints
    - Acts 20:18, 20, 27 – Paul’s example
      - Public and private teaching
        - “Whole counsel of God”
        - No omission of doctrine
      - Hos. 4:6 – “My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge”
    - Jer. 3:15 – “Shepherds… who will feed… knowledge and understanding”
  - Promote:
  - Audio sermons
    - Podcasts
    - Personal Bible reading
  - 2 Tim. 3:16–17 – Word equips believers
- Ps. 119:37 – “Turn my eyes from worthless things”
- True believers love the Word—feed them well

##### 2. Protecting–Guarding–Watching Over
- Reason: sheep = defenseless
- Dangers:
  - False teachers (OT/NT)
    - Satanic lies (Eph. 6:12)
    - Secular ideologies
  - Acts 20:28–31 – “Fierce wolves… from among your own selves”
  - Elders must be alert
  - Tasks:
  - Guard doctrine
    - Vet new members
    - Discipline sin
    - Stop infighting
    - Handle “bully rams” (Ezek. 34:17–22)
  - Heb. 13:17 – “Keeping watch over your souls”
- Spiritual Alertness:
  - Be awake, alive, engaged
    - Acts 20:31 – “Be alert”
    - David Gooding – “Unceasing vigilance…”
    - Stay updated on cultural/theological threats

##### 3. Leading–Managing–Governing
- Shepherd leads to:
  - Pasture
    - Water
    - Rest
  - Charles Jefferson:
  - Sheep = dependent
    - Need guidance
  - Elders =
  - Overseers
    - Stewards of God’s house (Titus 1:7)
  - Elders manage:
  - People
    - Finances
    - Church vision and values
    - Ministries and future leaders
  - Qualities:
  - Courageous decision-makers
    - Evaluative and strategic thinkers
  - 1 Tim. 5:17 – “Rule well” = worthy of double honor
- Common problem:
  - Elders not leading, only maintaining
    - People want good leadership

##### 4. Practical Care
- James 5:14 – Call elders to pray for the sick
- Acts 20:35 – Help the weak; give generously
- Elders = loving fathers, not executives
- Acts of care:
  - Name-knowing
    - Sick visits
    - Bereavement care
    - Phone check-ins
    - Encouragement
    - Counseling
    - Financial aid
  - Supported by qualified deacons (Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 3:8–13)
- Deacon tasks:
  - Aid distribution
    - Family support
    - Property oversight
    - Admin help
  - Effective deacon ministry = requires elder oversight

#### Working a Job and Pastoring a Congregation

##### Misconception
- “You can’t do job, family, and pastor work” = false
- People find time for what they love
- Examples:
  - Church planters
    - Tentmakers (Acts 18:2–3)
  - Elders can contribute:
  - Even part-time
    - Through wisdom and life example

##### Spiritual Laziness and Neglect
- Problem = spiritual laziness, not time
- Men delegate to wives or professionals
- “Women go to church; men go to football”

##### Spiritual Dedication
- Biblical eldership = requires:
  - True discipleship
    - Matt. 6:33 – Seek first God’s kingdom
    - Rom. 12:1–2 – Living sacrifices
  - R. Paul Stevens, *Liberating the Laity*:
  - “Pruned life”
    - Sacrificial lifestyle
    - Phil. 3:14 – Prize through sacrifice
    - Tentmakers = real contribution

#### Working as a Team
- Elders share responsibility
- Can be:
  - Full-time
    - Part-time
    - Quarter-time
  - Elders must guard against burnout
- Support each other

#### Deacons: Assistants to the Overseers
- 1 Tim. 3:5, 8–13 – Deacons assist in practical duties
- Tasks may include:
  - Hospital visits
    - Charitable management
    - Admin and property
  - Success = requires elder guidance
- Avoid deacon frustration via clear leadership

#### Every-Member Ministry
- Ministry = whole church, not just elders
- Elders equip saints (Eph. 4:12)
- “Body” depends on **non-leaders**
- Delegate (Acts 6:1–7)

#### Qualified Shepherd Elders
- 1 Tim. 3:1 – “A noble task”
- Requires:
  - Noble men
    - Godly character
    - Real abilities
  - Ch. 4: Will explore qualifications in depth

---

### *Chapter 3* | Shared Leadership

#### _
- Acts 14:23 – “They had appointed elders for them in every church.”
- Author’s personal testimony of blessing in elder-team ministry
- New Testament evidence shows **pastoral leadership = team effort**
  - James Montgomery Boice: no example of just one elder
  - Jesus modeled plurality with the twelve apostles
- Chapter structure:
  1. Equality and functional diversity among apostles
    2. Equality and functional diversity among elders
    3. Reasons for shared leadership
    4. Refutation of single-pastor model

---

#### Equality and Functional Diversity Among the Twelve Apostles

##### Equality
- Luke 6:13 – Jesus called twelve apostles
- Luke 9:1–6 – All received authority and commission
- Matt. 19:28 – All sit on twelve thrones
- Acts 6:1–7 – Twelve act as a body in decision-making
- Acts 15:1–29 – Twelve and elders resolve doctrinal crisis
- Eph. 2:20 – Church built on **apostles** and prophets
- Rev. 21:14 – Foundations = “names of the twelve apostles”
- No apostolic solo rule: Peter not elevated in rank

##### Diversity
- Peter, James, John – more prominent
- Peter = natural leader, not hierarchical superior
- Peter strengthened by group; group more effective with him
- Despite prominence, Peter held no exclusive title or ecclesiastical rank
  - Not head of Jerusalem council (Acts 15)
    - Described as “Peter” or “brother,” not “senior apostle”
    - Lived out Jesus's teachings (Matt. 23:8–12)

##### Model to Emulate
- Apostles provide model of **equality + functional diversity**
- Apostles initiated formation of **Jerusalem elders**
- When apostles left, elders assumed leadership (Acts 21:17–25)

##### Local Leaders, Not Apostles
- Elders ≠ junior apostles
- Elders = local governing body
- Apostles = unrepeatable eyewitnesses (Acts 1:21–26)
- Elders dependent on apostles’ teaching (Acts 2:42)

---

#### Equality and Functional Diversity Among the Elders

##### Equality
- Acts 20:28 – All elders = overseers by Holy Spirit
- Titus 1:9; 1 Tim. 3:2 – All must be able to teach and defend
- 1 Tim. 3:10; 5:22–25 – All must meet same qualifications
- James 5:14 – All may be called to pray over the sick
- Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 5:17 – All share same titles
- 1 Thess. 5:12–13; 1 Tim. 5:17, 19; Heb. 13:17 – All are to be loved, honored, obeyed
- Roles include:
  - Teaching, sacraments, decision-making, prayer
    - Mutual accountability

##### Terminological Confusion
- False distinction: pastor vs. elder
  - Common in churches with senior pastor + lay elders
    - Creates rank where NT teaches parity
  - Better: all called “elders” or “pastor elders”
- Samuel Waldron:
  - No NT distinction in title, office, or authority among elders

---

##### Functional Diversity
- Equality ≠ uniformity
- Gifts differ (1 Cor. 12:11; Rom. 12:8; Eph. 2:10)
- 1 Tim. 5:17–18 – Not all “labor in preaching and teaching”
- Some elders:
  - Have full-time teaching roles
    - Receive “double honor” (financial support)
    - Are more publicly gifted
  - Elders differ in:
  - Personality (Peter vs. John vs. Andrew vs. Matthew)
    - Skill sets (visionary, scholar, organizer, etc.)
  - Eldership allows use of gifts **without undermining council**
  - Council keeps all elders **accountable**
    - Teaching does not mean sole authority
  - Leaders among leaders
  - “First among equals” = prominence, not authority
    - OT example: leaders of thousands, hundreds, fifties
  - Jealousy must be guarded against (1 Cor. 3:3; Prov. 27:4)

##### No Formal Hierarchy
- Functional roles ≠ official hierarchy
- John Murray:
  - Parity is coequal with plurality
    - “There is not the slightest evidence” of hierarchy in NT eldership
  - 1 Cor. 12:4–11 – Spirit distributes gifts as He wills
  - Public and private gifts
    - Communicative and service-based gifts
    - Gifts of leadership (Rom. 12:8; Eph. 4:11–12)
  - Gifted teachers must not undermine eldership’s authority
- Council = final authority, not one gifted individual

---

#### Reasons for Leadership by Multiple Elders

##### 1. Human Fallenness Requires Accountability
- Jer. 17:9 – “The heart is deceitful…”
- Eldership = **accountability between equals**
- Prevents autocracy, laziness, imbalance
- Partnership = mutual growth
  - Jesus sent disciples out **two by two**

##### 2. Church = Spiritual Family
- NT emphasizes:
  - Brotherhood
    - Mutual respect
    - Lack of titles, clothes, status
  - Eldership structure fits **family-like community**
- Any qualified brother may serve

##### 3. Shared Labor
- Distributes emotional, spiritual burdens
- Crisis response = not one man’s job
- Eccl. 4:9–12 – “Two are better than one…”
- Elders pastor **one another**
  - Bruce Stabbert: “pastors for each pastor”

##### 4. Balance for Personal Faults
- Blind spots, eccentricities, ego
- Complementary strengths = full picture
- Prov. 15:22; 24:6; 11:14 – safety in counsel
- Elders together offer wisdom, not just one leader

##### 5. Christ’s Presence with Two or More
- Matt. 18:20 – Christ present with **two or three**
- Christ is always among His church
- Eldership reflects **Christ-centered governance**

---

#### Faulty Examples of One-Pastor Rule

##### Apostolic Delegates ≠ Local Pastors
- Timothy = evangelist, apostolic envoy
  - Worked under Paul’s direction
  - Epaphras = missionary evangelist
  - No evidence of solo leadership in Colossae
  - James = apostle to the Jews, prominent in Jerusalem
  - “Pillar” not “the pillar”

##### Angels of the Churches (Rev. 1–3)
- Symbolic, not pastors
- “Stars = angels,” not human leaders
- Grant Osborne: “angel” = always heavenly being in Revelation
- Even if human: says nothing of singular authority

##### Moses Model
- OT model = not for NT church
- Moses = unique, non-transferable role
- Ignores direct NT instruction on plurality
- Fails to account for:
  - Acts 14:23
    - 1 Peter 5:1–5
    - 1 Tim. 5:17–18

##### One Elder Per House Church
- No NT evidence for 1 elder/house church
- Claims are speculative: “we may suppose…”
- Wayne Grudem: “stands in same category as… elders being blind in one eye”
- Acts 14:23, 20:17; James 5:14 – Elders **plural**, church **singular**
- Hebrews 13:17 – “Leaders” plural, even in house churches

##### One Pastor-Teacher (Eph. 4:11)
- “Shepherds and teachers” = **plural**
- Daniel Wallace:
  - Shepherds ⊂ teachers
    - Not identical or two separate gifts
  - Not all elders = gifted shepherds/teachers
- Not all shepherds = elders
- Gifted elders = enhance team ministry, not dominate

---

#### Closing Thoughts

##### Core Hermeneutic Principle
- Build doctrine on **clear, didactic texts**
- Not on speculative, unclear, peripheral ones
- Texts supporting plural eldership:
  - Acts 14:23; 20:17–38
    - Phil. 1:1
    - 1 Tim. 3:1–7; 5:17–25
    - Titus 1:5–9
    - James 5:14–15
    - 1 Peter 5:1–5

##### Prominent Gifted Leaders ≠ Eldership Structure
- Many gifted men in NT:
  - 2 Cor. 8:18 – famous preacher
    - Acts 18:24 – Apollos
    - Col. 4:12 – Epaphras
    - Luke, Barnabas, Aquila/Priscilla
  - May or may not be elders
- Elders may call upon their gifts

##### Ordinary People Build the Church
- Unknown saints = heroes of the church
- Eph. 2:10; 4:1–16 – body built by many, not one
- God uses **common people** to build the Body

##### Final Question
- Why reject Scripture’s clear teaching on plural eldership?
- If NT had charged senior pastors, no one would question it
- Why undermine what is clearly stated?
- Trust the wisdom and sufficiency of God’s word

### *Chapter 4* | Qualified Leadership

#### _
- Jerome’s rebuke to Nepotian (4th century):
  - Churches focus more on ornate buildings than on qualified ministers
  - “To the choice of Christ’s ministers no heed is paid”
- Modern churches often neglect biblical qualifications
- Chapter goal:
  - Present biblical qualifications of elders
  - Preview chapters 12–14 and 20–24
  - Combine duties (chapter 2) and qualifications to define biblical eldership

---

#### The Apostolic Qualifications
- New Testament’s overriding concern:
  - Moral and spiritual character of elders and deacons
- Church offices (eldership, deaconship):
  - Open only to those meeting biblical requirements
- Biblical eldership = biblically qualified eldership

---

#### The Qualifications as Stated in 1 Timothy 3:1–7, 10
> *The saying is trustworthy: If anyone aspires to the office of overseer, he desires a noble task...*
> *(1 Tim. 3:1–7)*

- Starts with internal aspiration:
  - Spirit-given desire (Acts 20:28)
  - Not under compulsion (1 Pet. 5:2)
- Desire must be matched by:
  - Godly character
  - Pastoral capability

##### Let Them Be Examined
- Biblical mandate for public testing:
  - 1 Tim. 3:10; cf. 5:22–25
- Common church failure:
  - Appointing elders without examination
  - Leads to doctrinal or character problems
  - Often due to superficial nomination processes

---

#### The Qualifications as Stated in Titus 1:5–9
> *This is why I left you in Crete...*
> *(Titus 1:5–9)*

##### Elders, Overseers, and Stewards
- Terms used:
  - **Presbyteroi (πρεσβύτεροι)** – elders
    - Conveys maturity, dignity, community respect
  - **Episkopos (ἐπίσκοπος)** – overseers
    - Conveys responsibility, supervision, management
  - **Oikonomos (οἰκονόμος)** – God’s steward
    - Overseer is steward over God’s household
    - Must be competent, trustworthy, above reproach

---

#### The Qualifications as Stated in 1 Peter 5:1–5
> *So I exhort the elders among you...*
> *(1 Pet. 5:1–5)*

- Three terms used:
  - “Elders” (noun)
  - “Shepherd” (verb)
  - “Exercising oversight” (verb)
- Peter’s emphasis:
  - Elders’ motives and attitudes in shepherding
  - Christ-centered reward: “unfading crown of glory”

---

#### Reasons for the Qualifications
- Elders are:
  - God’s stewards over His family (Titus 1:7)
  - Guardians of the gospel message
- Therefore must be:
  - Spiritually, ethically mature
  - Competent in managing and teaching
- Elders must be examples (1 Pet. 5:3)
- Charles Spurgeon:
  - “A man’s life is always more forcible than his speech…”
  - Practice overrides preaching in influence

---

#### Qualifications for All Elders
- No distinction between:
  - “Ordained clergy” vs. “lay elders”
- Only two church offices:
  - Elders/Overseers
  - Deacons
- All elders must meet same biblical qualifications

---

#### The Right Temperament for Shepherd Leadership

##### Household Management
- Elder = faithful husband
- Respected father
- Proves himself in household management
- Parallel between family and church (1 Tim. 3:4–5)

##### Self-Control & Integrity
- Self-control in:
  - Money
  - Alcohol
  - Authority
- Displays:
  - Financial and doctrinal integrity
  - Fairness, uprightness, good reputation

  - Quick-tempered
  - Violent
  - Domineering
- Must be:
  - Hospitable
  - Helpful
  - Gentle
  - Lover of the Word
  - Joyful in teaching

---

#### Character Trumps Giftedness
- Structure alone doesn’t ensure healthy leadership
- Leadership requires:
  - Godly character over charisma
  - “Just,” “devout,” “self-controlled,” “faithful”
- Al Mohler:
  - “Character is indispensable to credibility”
- Biblical leadership = character-based credibility

---

#### Not Perfection or Sinlessness
- Bible presents flawed leaders
- Qualifications ≠ perfection
- Elders have:
  - Weaknesses, blind spots, inconsistencies
- Wisdom needed in evaluation

##### Example: “Self-Control”
- Not absolute
- Varies in degree and by culture
- Must be assessed contextually and realistically

---

#### Leadership Training
- Candidates can improve:
  - Through discipleship
  - Through doctrinal teaching
- Mentoring & education help meet biblical standards

##### Plan Now for the Future
- Rising difficulty due to:
  - Secularism
  - Moral decay
- Urgent need:
  - Discipling youth for future eldership

---

#### Fully Committed to Apostolic Doctrine
> *He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught...*
> *(Titus 1:9)*

- “Trustworthy word” = gospel of Jesus Christ
- “As taught” = apostolic writings (Scripture)
- Must:
  - Adhere to apostolic teaching
  - Reject theological risk-taking
  - Be reliable model of doctrinal fidelity

---

#### Able to Instruct and Defend Sound Doctrine
> *...so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it.*
> *(Titus 1:9)*

- Requirements:
  - Years of study
  - Reasoned understanding
  - Logical communication
- Elders must:
  - Articulate church beliefs
  - Defend truth
  - Instruct congregation

##### Each Elder:
- Different levels of skill
- None should be:
  - A novice
  - Biblically ignorant

##### Dual Role:
- **Teacher** – builds up
- **Guardian** – protects doctrine

---

### *Chapter 5* | Male Leadership

#### _
- Biblical eldership is plainly taught, yet often rejected due to:
  - Preference for senior-pastor model
  - Clergy-laity tradition
  - Objection to all-male eldership
- Biblical eldership **is an all-male eldership**
- Common objections:
  - Viewed as sexist or discriminatory
  - Pain of past abuse toward women acknowledged
  - Discrimination is a grievous sin

---

#### Binding Biblical Authority
- Christians are under God-breathed Scripture (2 Tim. 3:16–17)
- God’s design revealed in:
  - Gen. 1:26–2:25 (Creation)
  - Eph. 5:21–33 (Redemptive order after the Fall)
- Creation: Male and female both bear the image of God (Gen. 1:26–28)
- Gender role distinctions:
  - Designed by God
  - To be embraced, not erased

> John Piper: “Manhood and womanhood are the beautiful handiwork of a good and loving God.”

---

#### Jesus and the Apostles
##### The Male Jesus
- Born male by Spirit (Matt. 1:18; Luke 1:35)
- Theologically necessary:
  - Seed of woman (Gen. 3:15)
  - Bridegroom of the church (Rev. 21)
  - Counterpart to Adam (1 Cor. 15:45, 47)
  - Last Adam; Second man

##### Twelve Male Apostles
- Chosen after night of prayer (Luke 6:12–16)
- Appointed by divine guidance, not cultural accommodation
- Feminist claim: Jesus conceded to patriarchy
- Refuted:
  - Jesus openly rebuked religious culture (Matt. 22:16)
  - Not a coward or male chauvinist
  - Women welcomed, respected, and present (e.g., Mark 10:13–16)
  - Yet none were chosen as apostles

---

#### Paul and the Qualifications for Elders/Overseers
##### Context: 1 Timothy 2:8–15 precedes 3:1–13
- Women instructed:
  - To dress modestly (v. 9)
  - To focus on godliness and good works (v. 10)
  - Not to teach or exercise authority over men (vv. 12–14)
- Elder qualifications assume male subject:
  - “Husband of one wife” (1 Tim. 3:2)
  - Manages “his own household” (1 Tim. 3:4)
- Elders teach and lead (1 Tim. 5:17), which women are not permitted to do (2:12)
- Biblical structure for “household of God” (1 Tim. 3:15)

> “I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man” — 1 Tim. 2:12

##### Greek Word: αὐθεντέω (authenteō)
- Meaning: “to have authority over”
- Does **not** mean:
  - “Usurp authority”
  - “Instigate violence”
  - “Misuse authority”
- Supported by: *Women in the Church*, ed. Köstenberger & Schreiner

---

#### Gifted Women
- Women have spiritual gifts:
  - Can teach, lead, serve (Acts 16:14; Rom. 16:1–15; Phil. 4:2–3)
- Roles exercised without violating male leadership

---

#### The Original Creation Order Designed by God
> *Adam was formed first, then Eve…* — 1 Tim. 2:13–14
- Paul grounds argument in Genesis:
  - Not culture, education, or heresy
  - God’s creation mandate (Gen. 1:27–28)

> Kevin DeYoung: “To ignore…differences is to reject our creational design.”

##### Apostolic Arguments for Headship
1. Creation laws (1 Tim. 2:13–14; 1 Cor. 11:7–12)
2. Universal church practice (1 Cor. 11:16; 14:36–38)
3. Order in the Godhead (1 Cor. 11:3)
4. Command of Jesus (1 Cor. 14:37)
5. Christ–Church analogy (Eph. 5:23–27)

> Intent: Permanent, universal, not cultural

---

#### Harmony with Other Scriptural Texts
- Consistent with:
  - 1 Cor. 11:2–16; 14:33–38
  - Eph. 5:22–33
  - Col. 3:18–19
  - Titus 2:4–5
  - 1 Pet. 3:1–7
- Secular feminists:
  - Reject Scripture entirely
  - View distinctions as irredeemably patriarchal

---

#### Husbands’ and Wives’ Complementary Roles in Marriage
> *For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church…* — Eph. 5:23–27

##### Like Christ
- Male headship is not cultural
- Based on:
  - Christ’s headship of the Church
  - Sacrificial love (v. 25)

##### Like the Church
- Female submission:
  - Mirrors church’s submission to Christ
  - Not slavery or abuse

##### Marriage–Church Parallel
- Ephesians 5 = marriage roles
- 1 Timothy 2 = church roles

> “The church community must be structured in a way that supports the pattern of the family…”

---

#### Who Really Is Accommodating the Culture?
- Scriptural view held for thousands of years
- Post-1960s secular influence changed views
- Many Christians now:
  - Reject biblical distinctions under cultural pressure
- Takes deep conviction to stand against culture

---

#### Twisting the Scriptures
- Evangelical feminism undermines authority of Scripture
- Tactics:
  - Label texts as “obscure,” “temporary,” or “problematic”
  - Use Gal. 3:28 to override headship texts
- Consequences:
  - Bible appears to contradict itself
  - Undermines trust in Scripture

---

#### Women Gifted for Ministry
- New Testament support:
  - Acts 1:14; Rom. 16; 1 Tim. 2; Titus 2
- Women should:
  - Serve with spiritual gifts (1 Cor. 7:34; Acts 16:15)
  - Study Scripture and instruct (1 Tim. 2:11; Acts 18:26)
  - Evangelize (Phil. 4:2–3)
  - Engage in mercy ministry (Acts 9:36, 39)
  - Serve church (Rom. 16:1, 6)
  - Teach domestic wisdom (Titus 2:4–5)
  - Show hospitality (Acts 16:15)
  - Pray and prophesy (1 Cor. 11:5)
  - Care for home (1 Tim. 5:10, 14)

> Principle of male headship does not diminish the value of women's ministry

---

#### Jesus and Women
- No one honored women more than Jesus
- Women:
  - Ministered to him (Luke 8:3)
  - Were present at the cross (Matt. 27:55–56)
  - First to witness resurrection (Matt. 28:5–7)
- Yet:
  - Jesus did not appoint women as apostles or elders
  - Upheld creation design (Matt. 19:3–9; Gen. 1:26–2:25)

---

## **LUKE’S RECORD OF THE FIRST CHRISTIAN ELDERS**

---

  - Covers first 30 years of Christianity
  - Historical background for epistles
  - Provides earliest examples of elders at work
- Key texts: Acts 14:23; Acts 20:17–38
- Focus: elders in the church at **Jerusalem**

- Early on, under apostolic direction, a **team of elders** emerged
- Elders mentioned in Acts:
  - 11:30
  - 15:1–29
  - 21:17–26
- Possible synagogue influence on elder structure
  - Synagogue: “ruler of the synagogue”
  - Christian church: **plurality of elders**
  - Single-leader model emerged later (early 2nd century)

---

#### Elders in the Old Testament
- Eldership (πρεσβύτεροι / *presbyteroi*) was ancient, fundamental
- Elders: official representatives (Ex. 19:7; Judg. 21:16; Matt. 27:1)
- Suitable for patriarchal, family-based society
- Mentioned ~100 times in OT

##### Men of Counsel and Wisdom
- Wisdom assumed by title "elder"
  - Job 12:12; 29:21
  - 1 Kings 12:8,13
- Ezekiel 7:26: elders = source of wise counsel
- Job 12:20: God can remove elder discernment
- Lamentations 2:10; 5:14: silence/absence of elders signals doom

##### Educators of the People
- Elders had authority in civil, religious, domestic spheres
- Joined priests in reading the law (Deut. 31:9–13; 27:1)
- Responsible for justice and instruction in God's law

---

#### Elders in the First Church in Jerusalem
- Entirely Jewish believers
- Familiar with OT elder leadership model
- Luke assumed audience understood "elders"

##### They Received and Administered Money (Acts 11:27–30)
- Antioch sent **famine relief** to **elders** in Jerusalem and Judea (~AD 44)

- Antioch recognized Jerusalem’s elder structure

##### They Judged Doctrinal Issues (Acts 15:1–29)
- Conflict over Gentile circumcision and Mosaic law (v. 5)
- False teachers from Judea troubled Antioch
- Antioch sent Paul and Barnabas to **apostles and elders** in Jerusalem (v. 2)

###### Apostles and Elders Together
- Luke refers to them as a group 6× (always apostles first)
- Apostles had unique Christ-given authority
- Elders included because:
  - False teachers claimed Jerusalem's authority (v. 24)
  - Elders governed Jerusalem church (11:30; 21:17–25)
  - Elders had to clarify their position

###### Elders’ Close Association with Apostles
- Apostles traveled; elders took over daily leadership
- Their cooperation shows **shared responsibility**

###### The Council Meeting
- Called by Antioch, not Jerusalem
- Elders essential to consensus (v. 6)
- Result:
  - United decision (v. 25)
  - Confirmed by Holy Spirit (v. 28)
  - Written letter sent to Gentile churches (Acts 15:23–29)
  - Letter held scriptural authority
  - Affirmed gospel of **grace** (v. 11)
  - Letter obeyed in other cities (Acts 16:4–5)

###### Not a Recurring Event
- Acts 15 = one-time council
- No evidence of annual or universal councils
- Elders’ jurisdiction was **local**, unlike apostles (Eph. 2:19–20)

##### Jurisdiction of Local Church Elders
- Elders’ authority **limited to local congregations**
- No NT support for overarching ecclesiastical structures
- Apostles = only trans-local authority (eyewitnesses of Jesus)
- NT churches were **autonomous**, yet cooperative
  - No ruling bishops/churches over others
  - Inter-church letters were **persuasive**, not authoritative
  - Churches communicated and collaborated (Michael Kruger)

---

- Elders:
  - Hear Paul’s report
  - Glorify God
  - Propose action plan to resolve rumors (vv. 20–24)
  - Affirm Gentile freedom (v. 25)

##### Who Is James?
- James = Jesus’s half-brother (not apostle James, Acts 12:2)
- No NT title given (cf. Matt. 23:8)
- Called himself: “servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ” (James 1:1)
- Acts/Galatians:
  - Influential speaker (Acts 15)
  - Possibly an apostle (Gal. 1:19)
  - Regarded as church pillar (Gal. 2:9)
  - Letter addressed to Jewish diaspora (James 1:1)
  - Highly esteemed (Jude 1; Acts 12:17)

##### James and the Elders
- No NT evidence for James as “bishop” or sole leader
- Acts 15:
  - James = key speaker, not council chief
  - May have been both apostle and elder
- Acts 21:
  - Deliberation was with elders (not congregation)
  - Luke uses plural: **“all the elders… they said… we have sent…”**
  - Elders made crucial doctrinal and pastoral decisions

---

#### In Summary
- Elders were official leaders of Jerusalem church
- Responsibilities:
  - Administered charitable funds
  - Resolved doctrinal conflict
  - Judged complex issues
  - Protected church from false doctrine
- Eldership recognized by:
  - Paul and Barnabas
  - Gentile churches (Acts 16:4)

---

#### Elders, Presbyteroi (πρεσβύτεροι)
- Derived from **presbys** (πρέσβυϛ) = "old"
- Twofold meaning:
  1. **Older man** (e.g., 1 Tim. 5:1; Luke 15:25)
  2. **Office/title** (e.g., 1 Tim. 5:17; Titus 1:5)

##### Elders as Officeholders
- Not just "old men"
- Connotations retained:
  - Maturity
  - Wisdom
  - Experience
  - Authority
  - Honor

##### Plural Use and Collective Leadership
- Most common: **presbyteroi** (plural)
- Leadership is **plural and equal** among elders

##### NT Usage
- Total occurrences: 66
  - Referring to Christian elders: 17
  - Only once as **presbyterion** ("council of elders"): 1 Tim. 4:14
- Other uses refer to Jewish elders of Israel

---

### *Chapter 7* | ***Acts 14:23*** — Appointing Elders in Every Church

#### _
- Focus: Paul’s church-planting model
- Paul’s authority:
  - Apostle by Christ’s direct appointment (1 Tim. 2:7)
  - Authoritative emissary of Christ
  - Writer of much of NT (with Luke, >50%)
  - Defines gospel and church structure
- Paul's instructions = Christ’s commands
- Eldership as Paul’s deliberate policy, not cultural concession
- Common practice among apostles: plurality of elders in local churches
- Scripture = God-breathed guide (2 Tim. 3:16–17)

---

#### Luke’s Historical Record
- Acts 13–14: Paul & Barnabas' 1st missionary journey (AD 45–47)
- Gospel mission opens door to Gentiles (Acts 14:27)
- Great Commission in action (Matt. 28:19–20)
- Cities: Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, Derbe

##### Strategic Return Path
- Could have returned home directly from Derbe
- Instead, retraced steps westward to:
  - Strengthen disciples
  - Establish leadership
  - Appoint elders (Acts 14:23)

##### First Elders in Gentile Churches
- Significance:
  - First NT reference to Gentile Christian elders
  - Likely reflects **Paul’s normal practice**

##### Scholarly Affirmations
- **William Ramsay**: Acts 14:23 is a type for all later appointments (cf. Titus 1:5)
- **J. B. Lightfoot**: Early universal practice, mentioned once for typological sufficiency

##### Historical Gaps
- No elder references in Paul's letter to Galatians
- Acts 14:23 provides exclusive info on elders in those churches

---

#### Appointing Elders
- Paul and Barnabas appointed elders due to:
  - Need for structure in local churches
  - Spiritual responsibility for oversight
- Appointments were:
  - Deliberate
  - Theologically grounded
  - Apostolically authorized

##### "Appointed" — Greek: χειροτονέω (*cheirotoneō*)
- Meaning: to appoint, install, choose
- Common misinterpretations:
  - **Laying on of hands**: incorrect here (cf. Acts 6:6; 13:3 with verb ἐπιτίθημι *epitithēmi*)
  - **Popular vote**: wrong subject/pronoun structure (Paul and Barnabas are subjects)

##### Lexical Clarifications
- χειροτονέω can mean “vote,” but here = “appoint”
- Confirmed by:
  - Grammar (autois: "for them")
  - Context
  - All major lexicons & translations

##### Method Unspecified
- Role of congregation not disclosed
- F. F. Bruce: “The verb tells us nothing about the method of appointment”
- Likely included selection, examination, installation

##### The Importance of Right Selection
- Wrong elders → harm to the church
- Apostles had firsthand knowledge of required qualifications

---

#### New Converts as Elders
- Objection: new believers made elders too soon?
- Response:
  - Many were **Jewish God-fearers** or devout Gentiles
  - Knew OT Scriptures and synagogue life
  - Example: Timothy taught by Eunice and Lois (2 Tim. 1:5; 3:15)
- Resources:
  - **Septuagint** available for study and teaching
  - OT now read in light of Christ
- Instructional value:
  - 2 Tim. 3:16; Rom. 15:4; 1 Cor. 10:11

---

#### Elders in Each Individual Church
- Greek phrase: "in every church" = κατά (*kata*)
  - Distributive: "in each individual church"
- Eldership not general, but local in scope

##### Use of “Church”
- Greek: ἐκκλησία (*ekklēsia*)
  - Acts: 19 times
  - Paul’s letters: 62 times
  - Always refers to specific, local body of believers
  - Acts 20:28: “church of God, purchased with his own blood”

##### Plurality of Elders
- Not one "chief ruler" per church (contrast with synagogue model)
- **Multiple elders per church**, as also in Jerusalem

---

#### Committing the Elders to the Lord
- Danger anticipated: persecution, false teachers, internal conflict (Acts 14:22)
- Apostles **entrusted elders to Christ**

##### Greek: παρατίθημι (*paratithēmi*)
- Meaning: to entrust for safekeeping
- Direction of trust: to **the Lord Jesus Christ**
- Translations: “entrust” (NRSVue, NET, NASB)

##### Related Practices
- Acts 14:26; 15:40: Paul & Barnabas commended (παραδίδωμι *paradidōmi*) to God’s grace
- Acts 20:32: Ephesian elders commended to God and word of grace
- Pattern of **entrusting leadership to God**

---

#### Prayer and Fasting
- Context: part of committing to the Lord
- Community included in prayers

##### Emphasis on Prayer
- Apostolic dependence on divine guidance
- Luke 6:12: Jesus prayed all night before choosing the Twelve

##### Emphasis on Fasting
- Intensifies prayer (Ezra 8:23; Neh. 1:3–4)
- Signifies urgency, dependence, solemnity
- Acts 13:1–3: fasting before missionary commissioning

---

#### The Life of Faith
- Appointment = beginning of a lifelong walk of:
  - **Faith**
  - **Prayer**
  - **Obedience**
- Gal. 2:20: living “by faith in the Son of God”
- Elders called to exemplify this faith daily

---

## **PAUL’S FINAL CHARGE TO THE EPHESIAN ELDERS**

---

### *Chapter 8* | ***Acts 20:17–27*** — Paul’s Final Charge to the Ephesian Elders: Follow My Example

#### _
- Unique passage: only NT speech by Paul to church elders
- Acts 20: foundational for pastoral theology
- Key themes:
  - Elders = "overseers" appointed by the Holy Spirit
  - Elders' duty: protect the flock from wolves
  - Example-driven leadership
- Author’s recommendation: study entire speech deeply (cf. *Acts 20: Fierce Wolves are Coming*)

---

#### A Role Model for Elders to Imitate
> *Acts 20:18–21*

##### Paul’s ministry in Ephesus (AD 52–55)
- Fruitful years: *“all Asia heard the word”* (Acts 19:10)
- Adversarial years: plots, persecution, suffering
- Deep relationship with the Ephesian elders (Acts 20:17)
- Tearful final meeting at Miletus

##### “You yourselves know”
- Repetition: Acts 20:18, 31, 34
- Importance of **example** over words
  - 1 Cor. 11:1 — “Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ”
  - Phil. 3:17
  - Robert Tannehill: past ministry = future resource
  - John Wooden: “personal example” is the most powerful tool

---

#### Serving the Lord with All Humility
> *Acts 20:18–19*

##### “Serving” — Greek: δουλεύω (*douleuō*)
- Slave imagery: Paul as a **slave of Christ**
  - cf. 2 Cor. 4:5 — *“your slaves for Jesus’ sake”*

##### “With all humility”
- Christlike humility was central to Paul’s leadership
- Dangers for elders:
  - Pride of position, title, knowledge, giftedness
  - John Stott: pride = “chief occupational hazard of the preacher”
- Humble leader traits:
  - Teachable, approachable
  - Quick to reconcile, non-defensive
  - Promotes others, not jealous
- **Key leadership aim**: serve the Lord with **all humility**

---

#### Serving the Lord with Tears
- Deep empathy and affection like Christ (Phil. 1:8)
- Shepherding includes suffering with people (Rom. 12:15)
- Situations that bring tears:
  - Broken homes, sickness, death, addictions

---

#### Serving the Lord Amidst Persecution
> *Acts 20:19*

- Persecution from “plots of the Jews”
  - Organized conspiracies to kill Paul
- Reminder: faithful ministry involves suffering
  - John 15:18–20 — Jesus’ warning to disciples
- Paul models **resilience** and **courage** for the elders

---

#### Remember My Teaching and Evangelistic Ministries
> *Acts 20:20–21*

##### "I did not shrink from declaring anything profitable"
- Complete instruction in **gospel doctrine**
- No compromise or accommodation to cultural norms
- Elders received full theological training

##### Public and private teaching
- Public venues
- *“House to house”* — intimate discipleship
  - Effective for less public speakers
  - Ideal for depth and transformation

##### Core gospel message
- *“Repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ”*
- Paul: Herald of *“the way of salvation”* (Acts 16:17)

---

#### Total Dedication to Christ and the Gospel of the Grace of God
> *Acts 20:22–24*

##### Paul's travel to Jerusalem
- Aware of *“imprisonment and afflictions”* (v. 23)

##### “I do not account my life of any value...”
- Radical self-sacrifice for Christ’s mission
- Highest value: **finish the course**
- Core task: *“testify to the gospel of the grace of God”*
- Gospel = undeserved grace through Christ’s death and resurrection
  - Eph. 1:6 — *“to the praise of his glorious grace”*

---

#### Declaring the Whole Counsel of God
> *Acts 20:25–27*

##### “None of you...will see my face again”
- Tone: solemn, pastoral farewell
- Bernard Aubert: “a pastoral farewell”

##### “Innocent of the blood of all”
- Allusion to OT **watchman** (Ezek. 3:17–19; 33:1–6)
- Paul fulfilled his duty — no bloodguilt on his hands

##### “The whole counsel of God” — τὴν πᾶσαν βουλὴν τοῦ θεοῦ (*tēn pasan boulēn tou theou*)
- Second mention (cf. v. 20 — “anything profitable”)
- Synonyms in other translations:
  - “Will” (NIV)
  - “Plan” (CSB)
  - “Purpose” (NASB, NRSVue, NET)
- Divine counsel:
  - Sovereign, intentional plan of redemption
  - Isa. 46:9–11 — God declares the end from the beginning

##### “Whole”
- Emphasizes comprehensive doctrine
- Covers full biblical storyline and theology:
  - Genesis to Revelation
  - Adam to Christ
  - Ephesians 1:11 — *“works all things according to the counsel of his will”*

##### Result
- Elders trained fully
- Responsibility now theirs: **to teach, protect, and preserve the gospel truth**
- Albert Mohler: “Failure to teach truth leads to failure to even know truth”

---

### *Chapter 9* | ***Acts 20:28–31*** — Pastor the Church of God

#### _
- Transition from Paul’s example (vv. 18–27) to **direct apostolic charge**
- Elders must remain **vigilant** against false teachers
- Exhortation: *“Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock”*
- Central themes:
  - Vigilance
    - Divine appointment
    - Pastoral responsibility
    - Danger of false teaching
    - Eternal worth of the church

---

#### Pay Careful Attention to Yourselves and to All the Flock
> *Acts 20:28*

##### Main imperative of the speech
- Greek: προσέχω (*prosechō*) – “be alert, pay attention, take heed”
- Present tense, imperative: **continuous command**
- Linked to warnings of false teachers (cf. Matt. 7:15)

##### First: Guard **yourselves**
- First duty: **personal soul care**
  - Spiritual growth
    - Doctrinal soundness
    - Moral integrity
  - Known as:
  - “Soul care”
  - “Self-watch”
  - “Self-shepherding”

##### Then: Guard **all the flock**
- Biblical metaphor: *flock = local church* (cf. Ps. 78:52; Jer. 13:17)
- Comprehensive oversight:
  - Not just favorites, family, or supporters
  - **All** members are valuable and vulnerable
- Unity with Christ’s teaching: John 10:11–13

---

#### Vitally Important Reasons for Guarding God’s Flock
> *Acts 20:28–30*

##### 1. The Holy Spirit's Appointment
- *“The Holy Spirit has made you overseers”*
- Greek: ἔθετο (*etheto*) – “appointed, placed, made”
- Not self-made or people-appointed
- True overseers are Spirit-gifted and Spirit-driven

##### 2. The Role: Overseers
- Greek: ἐπίσκοπος (*episkopos*) – “guardian, superintendent”
- Emphasizes:
  - Oversight
    - Guardianship
    - Safeguarding apostolic truth

##### 3. The Responsibility: Shepherd the Church
- Greek: ποιμαίνω (*poimainō*) – “to shepherd”
  - ESV's “care for” weakens the imagery
- Task of biblical shepherd elders:
  - Be present with the people
    - Teach Scripture
    - Guide, heal, seek the wayward
    - Defend from wolves
    - Model godly living

##### 4. The Church’s Value
- Phrase: *“the church of God, which he obtained with his own blood”*
- Two translation options:
  - “His own blood” (traditional)
  - “The blood of his own [Son]” (preferred)
- Sacrificial, substitutionary atonement:
  - cf. 1 Cor. 5:7; Rom. 3:25; Eph. 1:7
- David Gooding: *“Mainspring of all true shepherding is the cost at which God bought it”*

---

#### Fierce Wolves Are Coming
> *Acts 20:29–30*

##### Certainty of Attack
- *“I know”* – prophetic certainty, not probability
- Church faces real, imminent danger

##### Wolves from Without
- Characteristics:
  - Fierce, ravenous, strategic, merciless
- Possibilities:
  - Pagan Roman persecutors
    - Judaizers (cf. Acts 15:1–2; Gal. 2:4–5)

##### Wolves from Within
- *“From among your own selves...”* – internal corruption
- Traits:
  - Speak “twisted things” – Greek: διεστραμμένα (*diestrammena*)
      - Pervert, distort Scripture
  - Aim to “draw away disciples after them”
    - Sectarianism, division
        - Elevation of self over Christ

##### False Teacher Profile
- Scripture twisters:
  - Quote the Bible out of context (cf. Satan in Matt. 4)
  - Use complexity, half-truths, evasiveness
- Sheep stealers:
  - Cultivate followers
  - Create factions
  - Intimidate opponents
  - Indifferent to church unity

##### Elder’s Qualifications (cf. Titus 1:9)
- Hold fast to sound doctrine
- Rebuke those who contradict it
- Teach with clarity, courage, and authority

---

#### Be Alert and Be Ready to Act
> *Acts 20:31*

##### Second main imperative:
- Greek: γρηγορέω (*grēgoreō*) – “stay awake,” “be vigilant”
- Present tense, imperative command: **ongoing alertness**
- Mental and spiritual vigilance

##### Paul’s Example
- *“Remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish every one with tears”*
- Characteristics:
  - Constant vigilance
    - Compassionate exhortation
    - Inclusive care (every one)
    - Admonishing – Greek: νουθετέω (*noutheteō*)
    - “To warn, instruct, advise for correction”

---

#### Satan’s Strategy of Lies
> *Eph. 6:11–12, 16; 1 John 3:8; John 8:44; 2 Cor. 11:13–15*

##### Satan:
- Real enemy, not metaphorical
- Jesus: *“a liar and the father of lies”* (John 8:44)

##### Satan’s Works
- Lies in every sphere:
  - Philosophical, political, economic, biblical
- False teachers are his servants:
  - Disguise as “servants of righteousness”
    - 2 Cor. 11:13–15 — *disguising themselves as apostles of Christ*

---

### *Chapter 10* | ***Acts 20:32–38*** — God, Finances, and Care for the Weak

#### Entrusting the Elders to God and His Word
> *Acts 20:32*

##### Paul’s transition before final encouragement
- *Greek verb:* παρατίθημι (*paratithēmi*) – “commend,” “entrust for safekeeping”
- Paul entrusts elders to:
  - **God** – personal, sovereign, faithful
  - **The word of His grace** – life-giving gospel

##### The God of the Bible
- Not:
  - Pagan gods (Roman pantheon)
  - Aristotle’s “unmoved mover”
- Is:
  - Personal, Triune, Sovereign Creator
    - Self-existent, faithful to covenant
    - Infinite: *Ps. 145:3*, *Isa. 46:9–10*

##### Purpose of the entrustment
- *“Able to build you up”*
  - Strengthen spiritual maturity
    - Edify for leadership responsibility
- *“Give you the inheritance”*
  - Among the sanctified
    - Eternal reward and inclusion in the family of God

---

#### Maintaining Financial Integrity and Caring for the Weak
> *Acts 20:33–35*

##### Paul’s Financial Example:
- *“I coveted no one’s silver, gold, or apparel”*
  - Direct contrast with false teachers (prosperity gospel)
  - Example of **selfless service**, not greed
    - cf. *Phil. 4:15–16* – accepted support, but didn’t seek it
- Material detachment
  - No desire even for **clothing** (social marker of wealth)
  - Motivation was **ministry**, not **material gain**

##### Paul’s Self-Support
- *“These hands ministered to my necessities and to those who were with me”*
  - Manual labor (tentmaking – cf. Acts 18:3)
  - Not ashamed of physical labor
  - Supported coworkers as well

##### Biblical Principles Taught by Example
- Elders must:
  - Manage church funds with integrity – *Titus 1:7*, *2 Cor. 8:21*
  - Be above reproach regarding money
  - Serve without financial manipulation

---

#### Helping the Weak
> *Acts 20:34–35*

##### The “weak”
- Not spiritually immature—but **physically/materially needy**
  - Elderly, sick, widows, disabled, poor
    - cf. *Acts 6:1–7*, *1 Tim. 5:3–16*

##### Paul’s Teaching on Hard Work
- Greek verb: κοπιάω (*kopiaō*) – “labor to the point of exhaustion”
  - Hard work = means to serve others
  - Reject idleness (cf. *2 Thess. 3:6–12*, *Eph. 6:5–8*)

##### Moral obligation
- Verb: δεῖ (*dei*) – “must,” necessity
  - Not optional, but *moral imperative*
  - Elders *must* care for the weak
  - Supported by Jesus’s teaching and example

##### Delegation to Deacons
- Deacons assist in care logistics (cf. Acts 6)
  - Elders maintain oversight, but share tasks

---

#### The Blessing of Giving
> *“It is more blessed to give than to receive.”* — Acts 20:35

##### Jesus’s Saying
- Not found in the Gospels — **oral tradition**
  - Consistent with Jesus’s teachings on money:
    - *Luke 6:38*, *12:13–31*, *14:12–14*, *16:13*

##### Principle
- Giving = higher joy than receiving
  - Reflects God’s character (gracious, generous)
  - Teaches **investment in eternal treasure** – *Matt. 6:19–21*
- A warning against:
  - **Greed**
  - **Material hoarding**

##### Gospel-shaped Finances
- Financial generosity = sign of spiritual maturity
- Elders must teach and **model** this principle
  - Paul: ultimate example of gospel-shaped generosity

##### John Bunyan’s Reminder
- *“The soul of true religion is the practical part.”*

---

#### Bidding Farewell
> *Acts 20:36–38*

##### The Final Scene
- Paul **kneels and prays**
  - Posture of humility and surrender
    - Not worship of Paul, but of God

##### Emotional Departure
- *“Much weeping... embraced Paul... kissed him...”*
  - Deep personal bonds
  - Brotherhood, not hierarchy

##### Leadership Model
- Paul was:
  - Relational
    - Loving
    - Inspirational
    - Not a “lonely leader” at the top
  - Contrast with *Diotrephes* – *3 John 9*
- Philippians 1:8: *“the affection of Christ Jesus”*

##### The Lasting Impact
- Paul’s mentorship:
  - Changed lives
    - Left a legacy of:
    - **Self-sacrifice**
        - **Doctrinal soundness**
        - **Compassionate shepherding**

---

## **WHO ARE THE OVERSEERS AT PHILIPPI?**

---

### *Chapter 11* | ***Philippians 1:1*** — Overseers and Deacons in the Church at Philippi

#### Context and Founding of the Church
> *Acts 16:9*

##### Paul’s second missionary journey
- Vision at Troas: Macedonian man calls for help
- Result: Gospel preached in **Philippi**, a Roman colony in Macedonia
- Church planted by Paul, Silas, Timothy, and Luke (AD 49)
- First church in **Europe**

##### Characteristics of the Philippian church
- Doctrinally mature
- Leadership structure: overseers & deacons
- Joy to Paul – *“affection of Christ Jesus”* (Phil. 1:8)
- Unique: financially supported Paul (Phil. 4:10–20)
- Epaphroditus sent with support
- Letter addresses gratitude and internal conflict

---

#### Acknowledging the Overseers and Deacons
> *Phil. 1:1*

##### Unique inclusion in salutation
- Overseers and deacons mentioned by title
- Possibly because of their role in sending support

##### Parallel with Acts 15:23
- Letter from Jerusalem: “The apostles and elders...”
- Suggests possible **formal letter from Philippi** signed by church officials

---

#### Two Official Designations
> *episkopoi* (overseers), *diakonoi* (deacons)

##### Recognized titles in Greek society
- Overseers = official leadership title
- Deacons = less prominent, but still official
- **Not merely functional** — denote office

##### Ernest Best’s conclusion
- Overseers must denote office
- Therefore, deacons likely held **formal office** too

##### Parallel: Philippians 1:1 and 1 Timothy 3:1–13
- Same dual office structure at **Ephesus and Philippi**

---

#### The Overseers
> *episkopoi* (ἐπίσκοποι)

##### Meaning of the term
- One who **watches over**, supervises, guards
- Better translation: **overseer** not **bishop**
  - *“Bishop”* is ecclesiastical and post-biblical

##### New Testament usage (6x)
1. **Acts 20:17, 28** – Elders called to oversee (Ephesus)
2. **Phil. 1:1** – Greeting to “overseers and deacons”
3. **Titus 1:5–7** – Elder becomes “overseer”
4. **1 Tim. 3:1** – Office of overseer (ἐπισκοπή)
5. **1 Tim. 3:2** – Qualifications for overseer
6. **1 Pet. 5:1–2** – Elders to “exercise oversight” (*episkopountes*)

##### Christ as Overseer
> *1 Pet. 2:25* – “The Shepherd and Overseer of your souls”

---

#### Overseers Are Elders
> *Acts 20:17–28*, *Titus 1:5–7*, *1 Pet. 5:1–2*

##### Interchangeable terminology
- Overseer = **function** (supervision)
- Elder = **status/character** (maturity, dignity)

##### 5 Textual Proofs
1. **Acts 20** – Elders called “overseers” by Paul
2. **Titus 1:5–7** – Elders and overseers used interchangeably
3. **1 Peter 5:1–2** – Elders to shepherd and oversee
4. **1 Tim. 3 & 5** – Overlap in tasks of overseers and teaching elders
5. **Phil. 1:1** – Plural overseers implies elders; else elders oddly absent

---

#### Early Christian Support
> *Jerome, J.B. Lightfoot, Chrysostom, Polycarp*

##### Jerome’s argument
- Bishop = Presbyter
- Philippi had multiple bishops, not hierarchical
- Supported by apostolic usage

##### Lightfoot’s research
- Widespread patristic agreement
- One office: bishop/presbyter

---

#### Multiple Overseers and Deacons
> *Plural usage in Phil. 1:1*

##### Plurality of leaders
- Common in NT: not one chief bishop
- Polycarp (ca. AD 115): letter to **one** church in Philippi
  - Refers to **presbyters and deacons**
    - No singular overseer mentioned

---

#### The Work of Overseers
> *Acts 20:28*

##### Overseers’ charge
- Shepherd the flock
- Guard against wolves
- Supervised care, doctrine, protection

##### Elders/deacons teamwork
- Elders: primary oversight
- Deacons: **assistants** in practical matters

---

#### Deacons
> *διάκονος (diakonos)* – assistant, helper

##### Key characteristics
1. **Linked to overseers** (Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 3)
2. **Subordinate** to overseers
3. Term best translated **“assistant”** (cf. BDAG)
4. **Qualifications required** – 1 Tim. 3:8–12
5. **Publicly examined** – 1 Tim. 3:10
6. Not teachers or defenders of doctrine (unlike elders)
7. No specific task list – responsibilities set by elders
8. Earn respect and grow spiritually through service

##### Purpose
- Support elders’ work
- Prevent overwork
- Free elders for prayer and Word – *Acts 6:4*

---

#### Two Offices
> *Overseers and Deacons* only

##### Contrast with 2nd-century structure
- No mention of:
  - Bishop
  - Priests
  - Three-tiered hierarchy

##### Polycarp’s Letter to the Philippians (ca. AD 115)
- Mentions:
  - Presbyters
    - Deacons
    - No singular bishop
  - Valens – elder in sin (named directly)

##### Polycarp’s self-identification
- Writes: *“Polycarp and the presbyters with him”*
- Not “bishop of Smyrna” in own letter

---

#### To All the Saints in Christ Jesus
> *Phil. 1:1*

##### Leadership in context
- “Overseers and deacons” mentioned **with** the saints
- Not over them, but **among them**

##### All are saints
- Leaders and led alike are holy ones
  - Set apart for God’s purposes

##### No clergy–laity division
- Paul refers to church as:
  - *“brothers and sisters”* (Phil. 1:12; 3:1, 17; 4:1, 8)
    - *“beloved”* (Phil. 2:12; 4:1)

##### Expectation of unity
> *Phil. 2:2*
- Elders and congregation:
  - Be of one mind
    - Same love
    - Full accord

---

## **THE BIBLICAL QUALIFICATIONS FOR PASTORAL OVERSEERS**

---

### *Chapter 12* | ***1 Timothy 3:1–2*** — Above Reproach and the Husband of One Wife

#### _
- Paul’s second missionary journey led to gospel work in **Philippi**, a prosperous Roman colony in **Macedonia**
  - Prompted by a **vision** in *Acts 16:9*
    - Resulted in the first European church plant (~AD 49)
    - Missionary team: **Paul**, **Silas**, **Timothy**, **Luke**
- The Philippian church became:
  - Mature and doctrinally sound
    - Structured with **overseers and deacons**
    - Full of **industrious gospel workers**
    - A source of **immense joy** to Paul (*Phil. 1:8*)
  - The only known church to provide **ongoing financial support** to Paul (*Phil. 4:10–20*)
  - Sent **Epaphroditus** with support during Paul’s imprisonment (AD 60–62 or mid-50s if in Ephesus)
  - Paul’s letter addressed:
  - Gratitude for support
    - Additional concerns (e.g., **conflict in the congregation**)

#### Acknowledging the Overseers and Deacons
- *Philippians* is the **only letter** in which Paul greets both **overseers and deacons**
- Likely reason:
  - Their special role in organizing the financial gift
  - Possibly sent with a **signed letter** (*cf. Acts 15:23*)

#### Two Official Designations
- *Episkopoi* (ἐπίσκοποι) – Overseers
- *Diakonoi* (διάκονοι) – Deacons
- Both terms imply **official church offices**
  - Recognized titles in Greek society
    - Not merely functions

##### Ernest Best’s commentary:
- “Episkopos” **can only** be understood as an **official office**
- “Diakonos” also used that way, though with **less frequency**
- Their pairing implies both were **officially recognized**

##### Parallel: 1 Timothy 3:1–13
- Overseers and deacons also present in **Ephesus**
- Reinforces official usage at **Philippi**

---

#### The Overseers

##### Definition and Meaning
- *Episkopos* = supervisor, one who watches over, guardian
- Not to be translated “bishop” (misleading in English due to ecclesiastical baggage)
  - Avoids reading **post-NT tradition** into biblical text

##### Usages in the New Testament
1. **Acts 20:17, 28** – Elders in Ephesus called **overseers**
2. **Phil. 1:1** – Addressed alongside deacons and saints
3. **Titus 1:5–7** – Elder = **overseer**, called God’s **steward**
4. **1 Tim. 3:1** – “Office of overseer” = *episkopē* (ἐπισκοπή)
5. **1 Tim. 3:2** – “Overseer must be above reproach” = *episkopos*
6. **1 Pet. 5:1–2** – Elders must “exercise oversight” = *episkopountes* (ἐπισκοποῦντες)
7. **1 Pet. 2:25** – Christ = “Shepherd and Overseer of your souls”

---

##### Overseers Are Elders

###### Paul's identification:
- *Acts 20:28* – **Elders** made **overseers** by the Holy Spirit
- Function: to **shepherd** the church

###### Term distinctions (same office):
- **Elder** – denotes **maturity**, **wisdom**, community leadership
- **Overseer** – denotes **function**, official **responsibility**, **guardianship**

###### Scriptural confirmations of equivalence:
1. **Acts 20:17–28** – Elders = overseers = shepherds
2. **Titus 1:5–7** – “Elder” and “overseer” used interchangeably
3. **1 Pet. 5:1–2** – Elders commanded to exercise oversight
4. **1 Tim. 3:1–13 / 5:17–25**
   - 3:1–7: overseer qualifications
      - 5:17: “elders who rule well” – no separate list of qualifications
      - Logical implication: **same office**
5. **Phil. 1:1** – If overseers ≠ elders, Paul omits elders – **highly unlikely**

###### Historical distortion
- Later separation into 3 offices:
  - Overseer (bishop)
    - Elders (presbyters/priests)
    - Deacons

---

##### Early Church Witnesses

###### Jerome (4th century):
- **Presbyter and bishop** are the same
- Paul’s use of **multiple bishops** in **one city** (Philippi) = multiple elders
- Churches governed by a **council of presbyters**

###### J.B. Lightfoot (19th century):
- Jerome’s view shared by:
  - Hilary of Poitiers (Ambrosiaster)
    - Chrysostom
    - Pelagius
    - Theodore of Mopsuestia
    - Theodoret
  - Consensus up to 5th century: **bishop = elder**

---

##### Multiple Overseers and Deacons

###### Paul's greeting (Phil. 1:1):
- **Plural** overseers
- **Plural** deacons
- No singular leader (bishop) mentioned

###### Polycarp (~AD 115):
- Wrote to “the church at Philippi” (not churches)
- Called believers to:
  - **Obey presbyters and deacons**
    - No mention of singular bishop
  - Showed elders were still **plural** and deacons active

---

##### The Work of the Overseers

###### Referencing Acts 20:28:
- Elders = overseers = **shepherds of the church**
- Must:
  - **Watch themselves**
    - **Guard the flock**
  - Protect from **false teachers**
- Deacons assist in shepherding logistics

---

4. Must meet **biblical qualifications** – *1 Tim. 3:8–12*
5. Must be **examined/tested** – *1 Tim. 3:10*
6. Not required to **teach or refute error** – unlike elders – *Titus 1:9*

---

### *Chapter 14* | ***1 Timothy 3:4–7*** — Managing One’s Household Well . . . Thought Well of by Outsiders

#### _
- Jonathan Edwards: Every Christian family = **a little church**
- The **home** is a proving ground for leadership in the **household of God** (*1 Tim. 3:15*)
- Managing a church ≠ business/military; it = **family management**
- Continues the list of elder qualifications from chapter 12

---

#### 13. Manage His Own Household Well
- Greek: προΐστημι (*proistēmi*) – “to lead, direct, manage”
- Applies to household leadership:
  - Includes wife, children, relatives, and servants
    - Must demonstrate **competence, stability, and responsibility**

##### The Father and His Children
- Must lead with **dignity**, not authoritarianism
- Children must be **submissive**, showing father’s **proper authority**
- Must not provoke or crush the spirit of the child (*Eph. 6:4*, *Col. 3:21*)
- Proper discipline =
  - Spirit-filled (*Gal. 5:22–23*)
    - Loving (*1 Cor. 13:4–7*)
    - Wise (*Prov. 17:6; 20:7*)

##### Children at Home
- Present-tense instruction: children **currently** living at home
- Passage **does not** require:
  - That elder has children
    - That all children be believers
  - Focus: **current management** of the household, not future outcomes

##### Basic Logic
- *1 Tim. 3:5*: “If someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for God’s church?”
- Logic: from lesser (home) → greater (church)

##### “Care For” (ἐπιμελέομαι, *epimeleomai*)
- Implies:
  - **Compassionate, personal attention**
    - Used in *Luke 10:34* (Good Samaritan)
  - Church leadership = **shepherd/father**, not CEO or officer

##### God’s Church
- “God’s church” (*1 Tim. 3:5*)
- *Acts 20:28* – “Church of God, bought with His own blood”
- Enormous **privilege and responsibility**

##### Imperfect Children and Fathers
- Bible: *Prov. 22:15* – Children have folly
- Goal: not perfection but **consistent, wise, Spirit-led leadership**

##### Judging the Qualification
- Requires:
  - **Knowing the man** and family
    - Evaluating through lens of “**above reproach**”
  - Danger: harsh, careless evaluations can deeply hurt the family

##### Rich Householder
- No requirement for wealth or status
- Even a **successful man** is disqualified without godly family management
- Protects against **worldly intrusion** into spiritual qualifications

---

#### 14. Not a Recent Convert
- Recent convert = baby Christian
- Risk: **confusing zeal or charisma** with spiritual maturity
- **Not ready** for eldership, which requires:
  - Time
    - Maturity
    - Experience

##### Spiritual Maturity
- Time and experience are **irreplaceable**
- New believers = called to **serve**, but **not lead**
- Must:
  - Know Scripture
    - Be respected
    - Show proven service

##### Arrogant Pride
- Danger of pride: “puffed up with conceit”
- Gordon Fee: “swelled-headedness”
- Especially tempting in **well-known, prestigious churches**
- Pride = first of the 7 deadly sins (*Prov. 6:16–19*)
- *1 Pet. 5:5*: “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble”

##### Fall into Judgment
- *1 Tim. 3:6* – “Fall into the condemnation of the devil”
- *Ezek. 28:11–19*: Devil fell through pride
- *Prov. 16:18*: “Pride goes before destruction”

##### Examples:
- King Uzziah – *2 Chron. 26:16*
- King Hezekiah – *2 Chron. 32:25*
- Nebuchadnezzar – *Dan. 4:29–33*
- Herod – *Acts 12:21–23*

##### Consequence:
- Personal disgrace
- Divine chastisement
- Potential faith **shipwreck**
- The Ephesus church may have suffered from ignoring this warning

---

#### 15. Well Thought of by Outsiders
- *1 Tim. 3:7*
- Reputation among **nonbelievers** is part of being “above reproach”

##### Apostolic Emphasis
- *Paul* and *Peter*: reputation among outsiders matters
- Poor reputation damages:
  - Church’s credibility
    - Evangelistic witness

##### Outsider’s Knowledge
- Outsiders may:
  - Know the candidate **better** than the church
    - Have **frequent contact** (e.g., neighbors, coworkers)
  - George Knight: outsiders may **see more realistically**

##### “Must Be”
- Greek: δεῖ (*dei*) – same imperative as verse 2
- Elders are **public representatives** of the local church

##### Fall into Disgrace
- Unfavorable reputation = **public reproach**
- Examples:
  - Dishonest businessman
    - Womanizer
    - Money-lover
    - Bad father
  - Consequences:
  - **Hypocrisy** called out by outsiders
    - **Embarrassment**, **discrediting**, **gossip**
    - **Damaged witness**, church’s mission undermined

##### Snared by the Devil
- *Eph. 6:11*: Devil’s schemes
- *2 Tim. 2:26*: Devil captures through traps
- Tools of entrapment:
  - Public criticism
    - Bitterness
    - Retaliation
    - Lying
    - Hypocrisy
    - Stubbornness
  - A **disqualified elder** becomes a **liability** and spiritual danger

---

#### An Elder’s Wife
- Not directly addressed in *1 Tim. 3:2–7*
- Likely implied in:
  - “Above reproach”
    - “Manages his household” (*1 Tim. 3:5*)
- Immoral, scandalous, or offensive wives = **disqualifying**

##### Related Verse
- *1 Tim. 3:11*: Wives of deacons must be:
  - Dignified
    - Not slanderers
    - Sober-minded
    - Faithful in all things
  - Argument from lesser to greater: if applies to **deacons' wives**, even more so to **elders' wives**

##### Application
- Evaluation of:
  - **Wife and children**
    - **Public reputation** of the family
  - All **responsible churches** follow this principle

---

#### Conclusion
- All **fifteen qualifications** for elders/overseers now covered (*1 Tim. 3:2–7*)
- Next: Examination of **elder candidates** (*1 Tim. 3:10*) and **laying on of hands** (*1 Tim. 4:14*)

---

### *Chapter 15* | ***1 Timothy 3:10*** — Qualifications Demand Examination. 1 Timothy 4:14 — The Laying on of Hands by the Elders

#### _
- Churches often mishandle elder selection:
  - Rushed votes
    - Lack of prayer or biblical examination
    - No character or doctrinal vetting
  - Paul insists: **qualifications demand public examination**

---

#### Public Examination
> *1 Tim. 3:10*

##### “And . . . Also”
- *Deacons*, like *overseers*, must be tested
- Greek:
  - “and” = δέ (*de*)
    - “also” = καί (*kai*)
  - Suggests implicit testing for elders
- Supported by: *1 Tim. 5:22, 24–25*

##### Scholarly Support
- **New English Bible**: “No less than bishops . . . undergo scrutiny”
- **B. B. Warfield**: deacons = like bishops must be “tried first”

##### “Tested First”
- Greek verb: δοκιμάζω (*dokimazō*) =
  - “to make critical examination”
    - “to determine genuineness”
  - Usage: testing of **public office holders**
- In this context: official, external examination by elders and the church
- Verb is:
  - **Imperative** – required
    - **Passive** – subject is **tested by others**
  - Testing precedes service:
  - **First** examined
    - **Then** serve

##### “Prove Themselves Blameless”
- Greek: *diakoneō* = to **serve (as deacon)**
- Conditional: only **if found blameless**
- “Blameless” ≠ perfect
- It means: nothing in **qualifications** disqualifies the man
- Related to “above reproach” standard

---

#### Why Deacons?
- Paul assumed readers already knew elders needed examination
- But perhaps **churches were lax** with deacons
- Paul insists: **same rigor applies** to both
- Many modern churches fail precisely here:
  - **Neglecting testing**
    - **Prioritizing convenience** over Scripture

---

#### The Laying On of Hands by the Elders
> *1 Tim. 4:13–14*

##### Paul’s Charge to Timothy
- Timothy had a **spiritual gift**:
  - Given by **God**
    - Revealed by **prophecy**
    - Affirmed by **laying on of hands** (elders + Paul)

##### Parallel to Acts 13:1–4
- Paul & Barnabas commissioned in **Antioch**
- Prophetic word → fasting → **laying on of hands** → sent out
- Acts 13 sets precedent for **commissioning by elders**

---

#### Timothy’s Missionary Commission
> *Acts 16:1–4; 1 Tim. 1:18; 2 Tim. 1:6–7*

##### Historical Background
- Timothy:
  - From Lystra
    - Trained by Eunice and Lois
    - Believer prior to joining Paul
  - “Well spoken of” in Lystra and Iconium
- Paul desired him as coworker in **Gentile mission**

##### Timeline
- Likely occurred during Paul’s **second missionary journey (AD 49)**
- Possibly simultaneous to:
  - *1 Tim. 1:18* – prophecies
    - *1 Tim. 4:14* – elders' laying on hands
    - *2 Tim. 1:6* – Paul’s personal laying on hands
  - Debate: whether Paul’s laying on hands = separate event

---

#### Prophetic Utterances about Timothy
> *1 Tim. 1:18; 4:14*

- Prophecy: revealed **Timothy’s gift**, not cause of it
  - Greek: διά (*dia*) = means, not source
  - Elders discerned God’s call for Timothy to:
  - Serve as **teacher/evangelist**
    - Assist Paul in **itinerant gospel mission**

---

#### Laying On of Hands by the Elders
> *1 Tim. 4:14*

##### Function
- Symbolic gesture of:
  1. **Blessing**
    2. **Partnership** in gospel
    3. **Entrusting** Timothy to God
  - Not self-appointed; not appointed by one elder or bishop
- **Elders acted in unison**, likely from Lystra (possibly Iconium)
  - Possibly appointed by Paul himself (*Acts 14:23*)

##### Clarification
- Timothy was **not**:
  - A local resident pastor
    - A bishop over many churches
  - He was:
  - Unmarried
    - A gifted **evangelist** (*2 Tim. 4:5*)
    - A **teacher** (*1 Tim. 4:6, 13*)
    - Paul’s **trusted assistant** (*Acts 19:22*)

---

#### The Council of Elders
- Greek: *presbyterion* (πρεσβυτέριον) =
  - “eldership” (NKJV)
    - “council of elders” (ESV, NASB)
  - Other NT uses refer to **Jewish ruling body** (*Luke 22:66; Acts 22:5*)
- Acted as official **representatives of the local church**
- Validated Timothy’s calling and commissioning

---

#### Encouragement for Timothy
- Paul reminds Timothy of:
  - **Prophecies**
    - **Laying on of hands**
  - Purpose:
  - Bolster Timothy's **confidence**
    - Reaffirm his divine **call** during difficult ministry in Ephesus
  - Robert Yarbrough: helps counter criticisms of Timothy’s **youth**

##### Ephesian Elders
- Reminder helpful also for **Ephesian elders**
- Validated Timothy’s authority to:
  - Rebuke false teachers
    - Restore church order
  - Affirmed Timothy was acting under **Paul’s apostolic commission**

---

#### Laying on of Hands Today
- Descriptive, not **prescriptive**
- Churches may **use or omit** practice
- Despite abuses (esp. on TV), it remains a:
  - **Beautiful symbolic act**
    - Useful for **public affirmation** of leaders or missionaries

---

## **SHOWING DOUBLE HONOR**

---

### *Chapter 16* | ***1 Timothy 5:17–18*** — Worthy of Double Honor: Elders Who Lead Well

#### _
- **1 Timothy** offers the most detailed NT instructions on elders
- Focus: elders who **“rule well”** = worthy of **double honor**
- Next chapter: addresses those who **“labor in preaching and teaching”**

---

#### Leading Well
> *1 Tim. 5:17*

##### Context
- Follows instructions to **honor widows** (1 Tim. 5:3–16)
- Now shifts to **double honor** for elders:
  - Those who **lead well**
  - Especially those who **preach/teach**

---

#### One Group, Functional Diversity
- **One council of elders** (1 Tim. 4:14)
- But diversity in function:
  - Some **lead exceptionally**
  - Some **labor in preaching and teaching**

##### Greek: μάλιστα (*malista*)
- Superlative of μάλα (*mala*) = “especially,” “above all,” “in particular”
- Not a defining term (“namely” or “that is”)
- Refutes view that only **teaching elders** are meant
- Supported by:
  - Vern Poythress: lexical evidence for “namely” is **inconclusive**
    - Paul could have used **τοῦτ’ ἔστιν** if he meant “namely”
  - Most translations agree on “especially” (ESV, NASB, NIV, etc.)

---

#### Summary of the Passage
1. All elders **govern, shepherd, oversee** together
2. Some **lead/administrate** especially well → double honor
3. Some **labor in teaching/preaching** → especially deserve double honor

---

#### Proistēmi: Lead/Manage
> *Greek: προΐστημι*

##### Meaning
- “lead,” “direct,” “manage,” “care for”
- Used also in *1 Tim. 3:4* (managing household)
- Perfect tense: have led and continue to lead well
- Used in *1 Thess. 5:12*: “are over you in the Lord”

##### Lead, Not Rule
- Elders do not “rule” as sovereigns
- Greek for “ruler”: ἄρχων (*archōn*) — never used of elders
- Jesus forbade authoritarian leadership (*Matt. 20:25–26*)
- Better terms:
  - “Lead well” (NASB 2020)
    - “Good leaders” (CSB)
    - “Provide effective leadership” (NET)
  - Prefer: **elder-led**, not **elder-ruled**

---

#### Elders Who Lead Well
> *lead = προΐστημι + καλῶς (“well”)*

##### Meaning
- Elders who lead **capably, proficiently**
- Not that others are bad — all elders deserve honor (*1 Thess. 5:12–13*)
- But some elders stand out for their **diligence and effectiveness**

##### Recognizing Exceptional Service
- Like deacons who “serve well” (*1 Tim. 3:13*)
- Elders who lead well are:
  - **Organizers, administrators, wise counselors**
    - May also **teach** in informal settings (small groups, 1-on-1)
  - Should not be seen as **“lesser” lay elders**
- Can receive **financial aid**, like teaching elders
- Plural “elders” implies flexibility in roles and number

---

#### The Spiritual Gift of Leadership
> *1 Cor. 12:28 – κυβέρησις (kubernēsis)*

##### Kubernēsis = “administration,” “guidance”
- Related to κυβερνάω: “to steer, pilot a ship”
- Translations:
  - “administrations” (NASB)
    - “leadership” (NET, NRSVue)
    - “guidance” (NIV)
  - LXX: *Prov. 11:14* – “Where there is no guidance, a people falls”

##### Meaning
- Gift for **strategic leadership** and **crisis navigation**
- Anthony Thiselton:
  - “Strategic statesmanship”
    - Ability to **steer through conflict and folly**
  - A gift of **order**, **governance**, and **direction**

---

#### Related Passages on Leadership

##### Romans 12:8
> *“The one who leads, with zeal”*

- Word: προΐστημι
- Translated as:
  - “lead with zeal” (ESV)
    - “with diligence” (NASB, CSB, NIV)
  - Paul anticipates **spiritual laziness**
- True leaders lead with **energy and urgency**

##### 1 Thessalonians 5:12–13
- Respect those who:
  - **Labor among you**
    - **Lead (proistēmi) in the Lord**
    - **Admonish**
  - Elders’ work is **labor**, not mere board supervision

---

#### A Good Example: Herb Banks
- Helped plant a church from 8 families → hundreds
- Not a public preacher
- Was:
  - **Administrator**
    - **Organizer**
    - **Accountability-keeper** for elders
    - Led **Bible studies**, had solid theology
  - Described by Paul’s words: **“led well”**
- Though not paid, was worthy of **double honor**
- Like *Stephanas family* (*1 Cor. 16:15–16*)

---

#### Ephesians 4:11–12
> *Gifts to the Church:*

- “Apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers”
- “Shepherds and teachers” = linked but not identical
  - All **shepherds** are **teachers**
    - Not all **teachers** are **shepherds**
  - Elders who combine **governance** and **teaching** are invaluable

---

#### Worthy of Double Honor
> *1 Tim. 5:17*

##### Greek: passive imperative – “let them be considered worthy”
- Not optional; apostolic command
- “Honor” = τιμή (*timē*):
  - **Respect**
    - Sometimes **material support**

---

#### “Honor” in Scripture
1. Not always financial (*2 Chron. 32:33; Prov. 26:1; Eph. 6:2*)
2. Sometimes includes material aid:
   - *Matt. 15:3–6; Num. 22:17; Prov. 3:9; 14:31; Acts 28:10*
   3. *1 Tim. 5:3–16*: honoring widows = **financial support**
4. *1 Tim. 5:18*: “The laborer is worthy of his wages”
5. Paul’s preferred terms: **grace, ministry, gift, partnership**, etc.

##### Implication
- Honor for elders includes **financial provision**
- True Christian “honor” = **respect + support**

---

#### Double Honor
> *What does it mean?*

##### Not:
- Literally “double pay”
- “Double the widow’s aid”

##### Possibly:
- **Abundant honor**
- **Twofold** = **respect + compensation**

##### Contextual Support
- “Worthy” in v17 links to “wages” in v18
- Reinforced in next chapter

---

#### A Scarce Commodity
- **Capable leaders** are rare
- Biblical, faithful, pastoral eldership is **demanding**
- Often low on benefits, high on conflict and criticism
- Therefore, those who serve faithfully are **highly valuable**
- Elders who lead well deserve **double honor** from:
  - **Congregation**
    - **Fellow elders**

---

### *Chapter 17* | ***1 Timothy 5:17–18*** — Worthy of Double Honor: Elders Who Labor in Preaching and Teaching

#### _
- Focus: elders who labor in preaching and teaching are especially worthy of double honor (respect + financial support)
- Tension: contemporary misunderstanding of elders’ role in preaching
- Case study: seminary professor unaware of elders' teaching role

#### Biblical Foundation
- 1 Tim. 5:17–18
  - Two subsets within one council of elders:
    - Elders who **lead well**
    - Elders who **labor in preaching and teaching** — **especially** worthy of double honor
  - "malista" (especially): emphasizes second category

#### Definition of Preaching and Teaching
- Preaching (logos): proclamation, exhortation, persuasive appeal to conscience
- Teaching (didaskalia): structured instruction, theological education
- Distinction:
  - Preaching: exhortation and appeal
  - Teaching: explanation and unpacking truth
  - Overlap inevitable; both required

#### The Nature of Labor
- Word: **kopiaō** – to toil, labor exhaustively
- Scholars:
  - Robert Wall: labor like physical exertion
  - George Knight: deliberate term for hard work
  - R.C. Sproul: preaching = physical + mental exertion
  - D.A. Carson: long-term study essential
  - John Stott: no sloppiness, persistent learning

#### Plurality and Diversity of Elders
- Elders in **plural** in Ephesus (rich and large)
- Antioch (Acts 13:1, 15:35): multiple teachers
- Implication:
  - Teaching gifts differ by **setting**, **effectiveness**, **style**
  - Not all elders teach publicly

#### Spirit-Gifted Elders
- All elders: “able to teach” (1 Tim. 3:2)
- Not all: **gifted to labor in teaching**
  - Driven by Spirit, diligent, fruitful
- Evangelism analogy:
  - All should evangelize
  - Some are **gifted evangelists**
- Teaching analogy:
  - All should teach
  - Some are **gifted teachers**
  - Eph. 4:7 – grace measured individually

#### Strategic Role of Teachers in the Church
- Jesus as ultimate **Teacher**
- Great Commission: evangelize & teach
- Acts 2:42 – devotion to apostolic teaching
- 1 Cor. 12:28 – teachers rank third
- Eph. 4:11–14:
  - Purpose: equip saints, build the body
  - Guard against heresy (doctrinal waves)

#### Compensation for Teaching Elders
- Double honor includes:
  - **Respect** (moral recognition)
  - **Wages** (financial support)
- OT & NT support:
  - Deut. 25:4 – don’t muzzle the ox
  - Luke 10:7 – laborer deserves wages
  - 1 Cor. 9:6–14 – principle of reciprocal compensation
- Greek: **misthos** – literal wages/pay
- Denying support = devaluing the gospel
- Calvin: "nothing more unkind" than neglecting such men

#### Practical Implementation
- Who decides? → elders
- How much? → context-dependent
- Every congregation must practice **faith-driven generosity** (2 Cor. 8:1–5)

#### No New Office Created
- Preachers/teachers ≠ a new tier
  - Still **elders**, not superior
  - No special **title** or **exclusive** roles
- Against hierarchy:
  - Early church drifted toward monoepiscopacy
  - Paul maintains parity

#### Apostolic Model
- 12 apostles:
  - Equal in rank
  - Peter prominent, not supreme
- Jesus’ commands:
  - “You are all brothers” (Matt. 23:8)
  - Leadership = service, not lordship
- Implication:
  - Titles like “senior pastor” violate elder **parity**

---

## **PROTECTING AND DISCIPLINING ELDERS**

---

### *Chapter 18* | ***1 Timothy 5:19–20*** — Protecting the Innocent; Disciplining the Guilty

#### _
- Context: chaotic and heresy-plagued church in Ephesus
- Paul excommunicated Hymenaeus and Alexander (1 Tim. 1:20)
  - Goal: corrective, redemptive church discipline (1 Cor. 5:3–5)
    - Purpose: protect the church and restore the offenders

#### Protection from False Accusations
**1 Timothy 5:19**

##### Paul’s Instruction
- Timothy was tasked with stopping false teachers and restoring order
- Timothy, as Paul’s representative, was to receive accusations with discernment
- Instruction:
  - “Do not admit a charge against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses” (v. 19)

##### Slandering Leaders
- Historical examples: Joseph, Moses, David, Jeremiah, Nehemiah, Paul
- 1 Sam. 24:9; Neh. 6:5–9
- Charles K. Barrett: faithful ministers are most vulnerable to slander
- Amos 5:10
- People often retaliate against leaders who correct them

##### Do Not Accept an Unsubstantiated Accusation
- Greek: παραδέχομαι (*paradechomai*) = “do not accept”
- Elders deserve same due process as others
- False accusations were likely in Ephesus’ climate
- Proverbs 18:8; 6:16–19; 10:18–19; 11:9; 16:28; 17:4–5; 21:23–24; 25:9–10; 26:20–22
- Proverbs 18:17; Deut. 19:15–20; Zech. 8:16; Matt. 7:12
- Principle: “No judgment without the facts”

##### Accusations Based on Proper Witnesses
- Not total immunity from accusations
- Basis: Deut. 17:6; 19:15
- Parallel: Matt. 18:15–17; cf. 2 Cor. 13:1
  - A charge that lacks corroboration must be dropped
    - Verified charges must be investigated
    - Even prominent leaders are not above investigation

##### A Meeting to Hear Witnesses
- Fair process involves:
  - Accusers presenting evidence
    - Accused providing a defense
    - Timothy + others making the judgment
  - Matt. 18:16 pattern
- If guilty party is unrepentant, proceed with discipline
- No procedure mentioned if elder repents — depends on severity, attitude, restitution, etc.

#### Publicly Disciplining an Elder
**1 Timothy 5:20**

##### Verse Context
- Thematic unity with v. 19 — not a new subject
- Elders specifically remain the focus

##### Sinning Elders
- Greek verb “sin” = ἁμαρτάνω (*hamartanō*)
- Present active participle = ongoing sin

###### Interpretations:
- **Ongoing Sin** (preferred):
  - Persistent, unrepentant behavior (e.g., Hymenaeus and Alexander)
    - Examples: heresy, divisiveness, lying, defiance
    - Requires public rebuke and discipline
  - **Present Guilt**:
  - Emphasis on the *fact* of sin
    - Still leads to public rebuke

##### Nature of Sin
- Not minor failures or mistakes
- Must be verified by witnesses
- Serious, unrepentant sin has grave implications for the church

##### Rebuke
- Greek: ἐλέγχω (*elegchō*) = expose, correct, summon to repentance
- Rebuke includes public correction and possible removal or excommunication
- Cf. Matt. 18:15–18; 1 Cor. 5:4–5; 1 Tim. 1:20; Titus 3:10
- Rebuke process involves public meeting
- Timothy authorized to call and lead this action
- Church leaders are accountable — not exempt from discipline

##### In the Presence of All
- Meaning: public rebuke before entire congregation
- Andreas Köstenberger: public sin requires public consequence
- Num. 32:23 — hidden sin brings greater destruction
- Public discipline controls gossip, misinformation, and distrust
- Ensures transparency and order in the church

##### That the Rest May Fear
- Purpose: inspire fear as a deterrent
- “The rest” = likely other elders, but also applies to the whole church
- Fear = shame of potential public discipline
- Deut. 19:16–20; Deut. 13:11 — public discipline produces holy fear
- Sin judged publicly helps others resist sin

#### Summary

##### Key Principle
- Charges against elders must not be accepted without two or three witnesses (Deut. 19:15–19)
- Elders deserve protection from unverified accusations
- But credible charges must be heard, investigated, and acted upon

##### If Guilt Is Proven
- Unrepentant elder must be publicly rebuked (1 Tim. 5:20)
- The sin must not be hidden
- Sinning elder must answer for his actions

##### Nine Practical Principles for Complex Cases
1. **Conduct thorough, fair, and impartial investigations** (Deut. 19:15–20; Matt. 18:15–20)
2. **Act with spiritual fruit** (Gal. 5:22–23; 1 Cor. 12:31–13:7; Gal. 6:1)
3. **Assess the sin’s nature** — does it disqualify from office even if repented?
4. **Discern attitude of the elder** — defiance vs. repentance
5. **Identify which qualifications have been violated** — above reproach? respectable?
6. **Use full biblical counsel for assessment**
   - Matt. 18:15–20
      - 1 Cor. 5; 2 Cor. 2:1–11
      - 2 Thess. 3:6–15
      - 1 Tim. 1:19–20; 5:19–29
      - Titus 1:10–13; 3:10–11
   7. **If repentant, restore to fellowship, but not necessarily to office** (2 Cor. 2:5–11)
8. **Seek wise counsel**
9. **Pray for divine guidance**

##### Final Admonition
- Church discipline is loving and necessary — reflects God's holiness
- Society disciplines for order — the church must do likewise
- 1 Cor. 3:16 — God’s temple must be holy
- Discipline reveals courage, obedience, leadership integrity
- 1 Cor. 5 — Do not imitate the worldly-minded Corinthians
- Leads into the next command:
  - “In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels I charge you to keep these rules without prejudging, doing nothing from partiality” (1 Tim. 5:21)

### *Chapter 19* | ***1 Timothy 5:21–25*** — A Call to Courageous Obedience and Helps for Appointing Qualified Elders

#### _
- Shepherding difficulty: disciplining a sinning church leader
- Temptations to avoid discipline:
  - Friendship
    - Family influence
    - Fear of consequences (division, loss of members)
  - Sole compelling reason to pursue discipline: God's command
- Paul's goal: preserve gospel integrity, church survival
- Call to courageous and impartial action (vv. 19–20)

#### Heavenly Observers
**1 Timothy 5:21**

##### In the Presence of God, Christ Jesus, and the Elect Angels
- Timothy’s responsibility witnessed by heaven:
  - **God**: Creator and Judge
    - **Christ Jesus**: Judge of living and dead (2 Tim. 4:1, 8)
    - **Elect angels**: heavenly beings observing and aiding in judgment (Rev. 5:11–12)
  - Motivation: Fear of God’s judgment > fear of people

##### Elect Angels
- Created beings, messengers, servants of God (Heb. 1:14)
- Witness human conduct (1 Cor. 4:9; 11:10; 1 Pet. 1:12)
- Did not rebel with Satan (2 Pet. 2:4; Jude 6; Rev. 12:4)
- Present with Christ at judgment (2 Thess. 2:7–8; Matt. 24:31)
- Watch over churches (Rev. 2:1), not just individuals (Matt. 18:10)
- Heb. 12:22; Rev. 5:11 — “innumerable angels”

##### The Big Picture
- Paul frames church leadership within cosmic accountability
- Obedience in eldership = obedience before the whole divine tribunal
- Leaders are always seen and evaluated by heaven

#### “I Charge You”
- Greek: διαμαρτύρομαι (*diamarturomai*) — solemn, authoritative exhortation
- “These rules” (ταῦτα [tauta]) = vv. 19–20 instructions on elder discipline
- Timothy to keep them:
  - **Without prejudging** (πρόκριμα [prokrima]) = no prior assumptions
    - **Without partiality** (πρόσκλισις [prosklisis]) = no favoritism

##### Without Prejudging
- Must not determine guilt/innocence without full evidence
- Natural tendency to pre-judge based on biases
- Justice requires objective, fair evaluation

##### Doing Nothing from Partiality
- Partiality distorts justice
- Common toward friends, prominent leaders, wealthy individuals
- God is impartial — leaders must imitate this standard
- Summary by I. Howard Marshall:
  - “Prejudging” = entering situation with a bias
    - “Partiality” = being swayed by loyalty or preference

##### Ignoring Sin in a Leader
- Churches historically reluctant to discipline leaders
- Motivation to discipline often arises only from legal pressure
- Lack of discipline reflects lack of fear of God
- God’s word > social discomfort
- Paul’s instruction = moral obligation before divine witnesses

#### Assessing Prospective Elders
**1 Timothy 5:22–25**

#### Laying on of Hands (v. 22)
- Symbolic act of public appointment (Num. 27:18–23; Acts 6:6; 13:1–3; 1 Tim. 4:14)
- Paul's command: “Do not be hasty”
- Hasty appointments = serious long-term consequences
- Requires: time, testing, training, and prayer

##### Parallel Instructions
- 1 Tim. 3:10 — test before service
- 1 Tim. 3:6 — no recent converts (danger of pride)

##### New vs. Restored Elders
- Most likely about new elders, not restored ones
- Need for replacements after discipline of unfit elders
- Applies to all appointments — new or restored

##### Consequence of Hasty Appointments
- Sharing in the sins of others
  - Philip Towner: appointer bears responsibility for future sins of unfit appointees
  - Greek: “share, participate in” = κοινωνέω (*koinōneō*)
- Appointers have moral accountability
- 2 John 10–11 — shared guilt via association

#### Keep Yourself Pure
- Timothy urged to remain unstained by others' sins
- Careless decisions could compromise his purity
- Maintain sanctification by following Paul’s instructions
- Examining candidates preserves leader’s integrity

#### A Little Wine for the Stomach’s Sake (v. 23)
- Personal digression rooted in “keep yourself pure”
- Paul shows care for Timothy’s health
- Encouragement: wine in moderation won’t compromise purity

##### Context and Reason
- Abstinence reasons unknown — possibly to avoid encouraging drunkenness
- 1 Tim. 3:3, 8; Titus 2:3 — warnings against addiction
- Rom. 14:21 — not causing others to stumble

##### Principle
- Balance between personal health and moral example
- Charles Barrett: “Duty of a good minister to care for health”

##### No Healing Miracle
- Paul doesn’t heal Timothy or Trophimus (2 Tim. 4:20)
- Paul himself endured physical ailments (2 Cor. 12:7–10; Gal. 4:13–14)
- God uses suffering to build dependence and humility

#### Helps for Assessing Prospective Elders (vv. 24–25)

##### Two Maxims
- Prevent unfit candidates from being appointed

##### 1. Conspicuous Sins (v. 24)
- Obvious disqualifiers precede consideration
- “Judgment” = human evaluation, not divine judgment
- Examples: history of vice (drunkenness, womanizing, etc.)

##### 2. Hidden Sins (v. 24)
- Not immediately visible — exposed through careful examination
- Patience in appointment process prevents participation in hidden sins
- God is not only one who can see sin — people can with diligence
- F. W. Stellhorn (via Lenski): no guilt for failing to detect deception if due diligence was applied

##### 3. Obvious Good Works (v. 25)
- Some candidates clearly qualified
- Good works precede formal evaluation

##### 4. Hidden Good Works (v. 25)
- Initially unseen, but discovered upon examination
- Such candidates should not be hastily dismissed
- William Mounce: delay ensures proper recognition
- George Knight: delay reveals worthiness

#### A Manageable Task
- Discernment in eldership is difficult, but not impossible
- Paul’s reassurance: patience and examination will yield godly elders
- Armed with Paul’s words, Timothy and the church can move forward with confidence

## **THE BIBLICAL QUALIFICATIONS FOR PASTORAL ELDERS**

---

### *Chapter 20* | ***Titus 1:5*** — Appoint Elders as I Directed

#### _
- Common disinterest in church polity is dangerous
  - Often treated as irrelevant (e.g., “like carpet color”)
    - Yet deeply **biblical, theological, and practical** in nature
  - Church government influences:
  - Roman power structures corrupted early church life (Kenneth Scott Latourette)
    - Pagan hierarchy = “the menace which was most nearly disastrous”
  - OT priesthood + Roman political forms → **clerical caste**
  - NT model of plurality lost in clerical centralization
    - 16th-century Reformation restored some biblical structure
  - Church order must match the **NT revelation** of the church
- NT **does** present a consistent form of church government
  - **Plurality of qualified, Spirit-placed pastoral elders**
    - Paul & Peter directly charge **elders**, not individuals like “senior pastors”
    - Titus was commanded to appoint elders — not optional, but **apostolic directive**

#### Set the Churches in Order and Appoint Elders
- Paul left Titus in Crete with a mission:
  - “Put what remained into order”
    - “Appoint elders in every town as I directed you” (Titus 1:5)

##### Historical Context
- Paul & Barnabas (AD 47): appointed elders in each new church (Acts 14:23)
- Titus (AD mid-60s): similar task, continuation of apostolic practice
- Crete had churches but **no elders yet** (as far as we know)

##### Cretan Churches
- Possible early origin:
  - Pentecost (AD 30): Cretan Jews heard Peter’s sermon (Acts 2:11)
    - Jewish communities present historically
  - Other evangelists may have visited the island
- Churches = fledgling, weak, threatened by **Jewish false teachers** (Titus 1:10)

##### Paul’s Instructions
- Titus was Paul’s close coworker (Gal. 2:1–3; 2 Cor. 7:6–14; 8:6)
- Not an elder himself, but acted as **Paul’s apostolic representative**
- Letter intended to be **read publicly** (Titus 3:15)
- Titus’s role: act with **apostolic authority** (Titus 2:15)

##### Titus’s Assignments
- Twofold task:
  - “Put what remained into order” (Gk: ἐπιδιορθόω *epidiorthoō*)
      - Can imply correction or completion
        - Likely includes both (Towner)
      - “Appoint elders in every town” (specific starting point)
      - Gk: **λείπω** (*leipō*) = “what is lacking”
        - NIV: “what was left unfinished”
        - CSB: “left undone”

#### “Appoint Elders”
- Central mission of Titus’s role (Titus 1:5)
- Urgent need due to doctrinal and leadership deficiencies

##### “Appoint” — Greek: καθίστημι (*kathistēmi*)
- Used for formal installation to office
- Acts 6:3 — Apostles appointed the Seven
- Always involves **authority**

##### Titus’s Authority
- Paul trusted Titus after decades of cooperation
- He knew Paul's mind and strategy
- Titus is **never called an elder/overseer** himself

##### Plural Elders
- Paul’s consistent practice: plurality of elders (cf. Acts 14:23; 20:17)
- Not one-man leadership, not context-driven pragmatism
- NT local churches = town-wide congregations
  - “Church in Ephesus,” not “churches in Ephesus”
    - “Elders of the church” (Acts 20:17; Rev. 2:1)

##### “As I Directed”
- Titus is not to innovate
- Gk: διατάσσω (*diatassō*) = command, order
- Emphatic “I” (ἐγώ *egō*) — authoritative apostolic command
- Must follow specific directives about who qualifies as elders (vv. 6–9)
- F. F. Bruce’s paraphrase captures the force:
  - Titus to **appoint elders**
    - But only those who fit the profile of “beyond reproach”
    - Elders must **match the role of a steward in God’s house**

#### Ordination
##### NT Terminology
- KJV translates *kathistēmi* as “ordain” — can mislead
- NT uses several verbs without priestly or mystical connotations:
  - Acts 20:28 — **τίθημι** (*tithēmi*): “made”
    - Titus 1:5 — **καθίστημι** (*kathistēmi*): “appoint”
    - Acts 14:23 — **χειροτονέω** (*cheirotoneō*): “appointed”
    - Mark 3:14 — **ποιέω** (*poieō*): “appointed”
    - John 15:16 — **τίθημι** (*tithēmi*): “appointed”

##### No Sacral Language in Paul’s Letters
- “Ordain” not found in the sense of a priestly ritual
- Protestant views differ:
  - Some treat ordination as quasi-sacramental
    - Others use it as public recognition without mystical claims
  - Author avoids the term due to its common misuse

##### NT Simplicity
- No sacred ceremony
- No holy garments
- No anointing oil
- All such additions are later distortions of NT practice
- NT elders are not priests — all believers are a **royal priesthood** (1 Pet. 2:9)

##### Biblical Practice
- Eldership is a **noble task** (1 Tim. 3:1)
  - Empowered by the Holy Spirit (Acts 20:28)
  - NT language: “appoint,” “commend,” “install”
- Public installation may or may not involve laying on of hands (1 Tim. 4:14; 5:22)
- Must **always** include public examination based on Scripture
  - 1 Tim. 3:1–13; Titus 1:5–9

##### Governmental Recognition
- Churches may need to conform to civil regulations
  - Marriage authority, hospital access, military exemption, etc.
  - Accommodations possible:
  - Licensing
    - Letters of commendation
  - These do not compromise biblical doctrine on ordination

---

### *Chapter 21* | ***Titus 1:6*** — Above Reproach as a Husband and Father

#### _
- Paul commanded Titus to appoint **elders in every town**
  - Titus 1:5: clear delegation of authority to organize the churches
  - The appointment must be based on **strict qualifications** (vv. 6–9)
  - Titus must follow Paul’s instructions precisely
    - Eldership is not open to anyone — character and household matter deeply
  - Verse 6: switch from plural **“elders”** to singular **“if anyone” (τίς [tis])**
  - Highlights that **each individual** must meet these qualifications

#### Marriage and Children
- Two family-based qualifications:
  - **“Husband of one wife”** (marital faithfulness)
    - **“Children are believers” / “faithful”** (parental leadership)

##### 1. Above Reproach
- Same as in 1 Timothy 3:2
- Overarching standard covering all other qualifications
- Free from **moral accusation** or **public scandal**
- Critical that no behavior discredits the gospel or the church

##### 2. The Husband of One Wife
- Marital faithfulness, not marital status
- Not a prohibition against remarriage or singleness
- Covered extensively in chapter 12 and at www.eldershipbook.com

##### 3. The Children’s Standing
- Greek adjective: **πιστός (*pistos*)** = either:
  - “believers” (ESV, NASB, NIV, NLT)
    - “faithful/trustworthy” (CSB, NET, NKJV, KJV)

###### View 1: Children must be Believers
- Common translations render **pistos** as "believers"
- Argument:
  - Paul uses a different word than 1 Tim. 3:4 (“submissive” = ὑποταγή [hypotagē])
    - Suggests he intends something **stronger**, i.e., saving faith
  - Possible concern: stricter than 1 Tim. 3:4, but not inconsistent

###### View 2: Children must be Faithful / Trustworthy
- Supported by alternative translations
- Emphasizes proper **behavior and submission**, not salvation status
- Consistent with usage in:
  - Matt. 24:45–51; 25:21, 23
    - 1 Cor. 4:17; 1 Tim. 3:11; Titus 1:9
    - LXX 1 Sam. 2:35 (faithful priest)

###### Supporting Arguments
- **Stronger contrast** in the verse itself:
  - “faithful” vs. “debauchery” (ἀσωτία [asōtia]) & “insubordination” (ἀνυπότακτος [anupotaktos])
    - Not “unbelievers,” but **rebellious, wild, disgraceful** behavior
  - Even unsaved children can be **orderly** and **respectful**
- A child’s faith is not fully in a parent’s control
  - Salvation is **God’s work** (John 1:12–13)

###### Practical Questions (if children must be believers)
- Do all children need to believe? By what age?
- What about a rebellious or mentally ill child?
- What if children believe, but display immature behavior?
- What if a previously faithful adult child **walks away** from the faith?

###### Simpler Interpretation
- Titus 1:6 = **faithful/trustworthy**, consistent with 1 Tim. 3:4
- Tests:
  - Do children obey and honor their father’s authority in the home?
    - Are they free from **public charges** of rebellion or immorality?

###### Adult Children
- Concern is primarily **children under a father’s authority**
- Disqualification arises from poor **household management**, not adult choices
- Adult apostasy does not automatically disqualify a father-elder
  - The issue is household supervision, not adult independence

---

#### An Overseer as God’s Steward
**Titus 1:7**

##### Must Be Above Reproach
- **Repetition** of the phrase for emphasis
  - Gk. δεῖ (*dei*) — “it is necessary”
  - Non-negotiable requirement
- Applies to **personal** and **public** life

##### “For” — Logical Connector
- Gk. γάρ (*gar*): ties v. 6 (family) to v. 7 (church responsibility)
- Overseer must be above reproach because he is God’s **household steward**
- Same logic as 1 Tim. 3:5: home leadership reflects readiness for church oversight

---

#### The Switch to “Overseer” (ἐπίσκοπος [episkopos])
- Not a new or distinct office
- **Elder** and **overseer** used interchangeably
- Overseer = **functional title**, Elder = **maturity title**
- Gk. singular used generically, just like “if anyone…” in v. 6
- Shift likely due to imagery: “steward” fits better with “overseer”

---

#### God’s Steward of God’s Household
- Gk. οἰκονόμος (*oikonomos*): household manager
- Overseer’s authority = **delegated** by God
- Overseer must be:
  - Morally qualified
    - Spiritually trustworthy
    - Able to handle responsibility

##### Role of a Steward
- Ancient household manager:
  - Controlled budgets, debts, supplies, personnel
    - Operated under the master’s authority
  - Overseer must **not act independently**, but on behalf of **God the Master**
  - The **church is God’s**, not the overseer’s

##### Summary:
- An elder/overseer is a **God-appointed steward** over **God’s household**
- Therefore, he must:
  - Be **above reproach** in **marriage**, **parenting**, and **personal life**
    - Demonstrate the ability to manage responsibly
    - Be accountable to **God**, not simply to the congregation

---

### *Chapter 22* | ***Titus 1:7–8*** — The Biblical Qualifications for God’s Steward

#### _
- Continuing from the prior focus on being **above reproach**
- Paul gives:
  - **5 disqualifying vices** to avoid (v. 7)
    - **7 positive virtues** to cultivate (vv. 8–9)
  - A man possessing any of the vices is **disqualified** from eldership
- An elder must demonstrate the **spiritual maturity** and **moral excellence** required of a **steward of God’s household**

---

#### Five Disqualifying Vices (v. 7)
> “He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain.”

##### 4. Not Arrogant
- Greek: **αὐθάδης (*authadēs*)** — self-willed, stubborn, self-pleasing
- NASB/NKJV: “not self-willed”; NIV: “not overbearing”
- Defined as:
  - Arrogant due to stubborn self-will
    - Self-centered, dismissive of others, autocratic
  - **Example: Diotrephes** (3 John 9–10)
  - Controlled people
    - Rejected apostolic authority
    - Intimidated the congregation
  - Not a **team player** → fails in shared leadership
- **Rejects accountability** → desires unchecked authority
- In contrast: true elders show **gentleness** (1 Tim. 3:3)
- Strong leadership ≠ arrogance
  - Even Paul rebuked and disciplined without arrogance (e.g., 1 Cor. 5; Gal. 2)

##### 5. Not Quick-Tempered
- Greek: **ὀργίλος (*orgilos*)** — prone to anger, short-fused
- CSB: “not hot-tempered”; NET: “not prone to anger”
- Anger disqualifies:
  - Clouds judgment
    - Destroys unity
    - Provokes fear/intimidation
  - Hudson Taylor (missionary) admitted personal struggle with anger
- The elder must control emotions under stress and conflict

##### 6. Not a Drunkard
- Not addicted or overindulgent in alcohol
- See also: 1 Tim. 3:3 (chapter 13)
- Elders must demonstrate **sobriety** and **moderation**

##### 7. Not Violent
- No place for verbal or physical **aggression** in a church leader
- See also: 1 Tim. 3:3 (chapter 13)

##### 8. Not Greedy for Gain
- Greek: **αἰσχροκερδής (*aischrokerdēs*)** — greedy for shameful gain
- Related:
  - 1 Tim. 3:3 – “lover of money”
    - 1 Pet. 5:2 – “not for shameful gain”
  - Traits to watch for:
  - Manipulative control over church funds
    - Exploiting vulnerable people
    - Materialism in disguise as ministry
  - Elders must show **generosity**, not exploitation
- Paul: “It is more blessed to give than to receive” (Acts 20:35)

##### Summary of Vices (Knight):
- Reflect the **sins of self**:
  - **Pride** → arrogance
    - **Anger** → quick temper
    - **Desire** → for drink, dominance, wealth
  - Any one disqualifies a man from stewardship

---

#### Seven Positive Virtues (vv. 8–9)
> “But [he must be] hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined…”

##### 9. Hospitable

- Modeled by Paul: disciplined body to avoid disqualification (1 Cor. 9:24–27)

---

#### Summary
- Elders must exhibit **absence of corrupting vices** and the **presence of Spirit-shaped character**
- Five vices destroy stewardship; seven virtues protect it
- The elder is **God’s steward**, not his own master
  - He must manage God's household with:
    - **Humility**

### *Chapter 23* | ***Titus 1:9–13*** — Able to Exhort in Sound Doctrine and Rebuke False Teachers

#### _

- Titus 1:7, 9
  - Emphasizes the most critical qualification for elders
  - Threefold structure:
    - 15a. Hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught
    - 15b. Able to exhort in sound doctrine
    - 15c. Able to rebuke those who contradict it

#### 15a. He Must Hold Firm to the Trustworthy Word as Taught by the Apostle

- Greek: ἀντέχω (antechō) – to cling, hold fast, be devoted to
  - Suggests:
    - Unshakable conviction
    - Withstanding opposition
- No room for:
  - Doctrinal ambiguity
  - Uncertainty of message
- Must demonstrate:
  - Unwavering commitment to gospel as revealed in Scripture

##### The Word (λόγος [logos])

- Refers to original preaching of the gospel message
- Biblical examples:
  - Acts 4:4; Acts 4:29, 31; Acts 6:2, 4, 7; Acts 8:25; Acts 13:26
  - 1 Cor. 1:18; 2 Cor. 5:19; Eph. 1:13; Phil. 2:16
  - Col. 1:5; Col. 3:16; 1 Thess. 2:13
- Entrusted to Paul by command of God (Titus 1:3)
- Contrasted with:
  - "Word of men" (1 Thess. 2:13)
  - False teachers' redefined counterfeit gospel

##### Two Descriptors of the Word

- **Trustworthy** – Reliable, faithful (cf. Titus 1:10)
- **As taught** – Κατὰ τὴν διδαχήν (kata tēn didachēn)
  - Didachē (διδαχή) = content of apostolic teaching (2 Tim. 4:2)

##### According to the Teaching (Romans 6:17)

- “Standard of teaching” received by Paul (Gal. 1:1, 11–12, 15; 1 Cor. 15:1–4)
- Apostolic body of doctrine
  - Must be:
    - Believed
    - Guarded
    - Taught by elders
- Failure to hold fast leads to:
  - Confusion
  - Leadership failure
  - Spiritual danger for the church

#### 15b. Able to Exhort in Sound Doctrine

- Purpose of “holding firm” to the trustworthy word:
  - Exhortation (παρακαλέω [parakaleō])
  - Refutation of contradictors
- John Calvin: Two voices for a pastor
  - Gather sheep
  - Drive away wolves
- Parakaleō: Exhort, encourage, urge, implore
  - Emphasizes:
    - Instruction with practical bent
    - Persuasion and command
    - Compelling implementation of faith
- Paul to Timothy:
  - 1 Tim. 6:2; 1 Tim. 4:13; 2 Tim. 4:2

##### All Elders

- Qualification applies to all elders, not just preachers (1 Tim. 5:17)
- 1 Tim. 3:2: "Able to teach"
- All elders must:
  - Know doctrine
  - Exhort in it
  - Refute errors

##### Sound Doctrine

- Greek: ὑγιαίνω (hygiainō) – to be healthy
  - Doctrine = healthy vs. diseased (1 Tim. 6:3–5; 2 Tim. 2:17–19)
  - False teaching = “doctrines of demons” (1 Tim. 4:1)
- Didaskalia (διδασκαλία)
  - Teaching as content (esp. in Pastorals – 15 of 21 NT uses)
  - Synonymous with didachē in this context
  - Emphasis: spiritual health through sound doctrine

#### 15c. Able to Rebuke Those Who Contradict Sound Doctrine

- Key support texts:
  - Titus 1:10–11, 13
  - Titus 3:4–7; 2 Tim. 1:8–11
- Issue in Crete:
  - Many false teachers (especially of the circumcision party)
  - Spreading dangerous, divisive, and heretical teachings

##### Long-term Strategy

- Multiply true teachers to oppose many false ones
- Equip elders to:
  - Rebuke
  - Teach
  - Guard the church

##### Greek: ἀντιλέγω (antilegō)

- Means: “speak against,” “oppose”
- False teachers opposed Paul’s gospel
  - Promoted:
    - Jewish myths
    - Man-made rituals
    - Empty asceticism

##### Sharply Rebuke the Opponents

- Greek:
  - ἐλέγχω (elegchō) – reprove, correct
  - ἀποτόμως (apotomōs) – sharply, severely
- Elders must:
  - Rebuke with authority
  - Not abandon post when gospel is attacked
  - Guard the gospel even against fellow elders (Acts 20:30)
- Traits of false teachers:
  - Slippery, subtle, twist Scripture
  - Mix truth with error
  - Tire people with endless arguments

##### Hope for Repentance

- Goal of rebuke: “that they may be sound in the faith” (Titus 1:13)
- Approach must be:
  - Firm
  - Spirit-filled (2 Tim. 2:24–26)
  - No compromise with error

#### Silence the Opponents

- Titus 1:11 – “They must be silenced”
- Greek: muzzle, gag (strong command)
- Reason:
  - Upsetting whole families
  - Teaching for shameful gain
- Strategy:
  - Public confrontation
  - Disfellowship if no repentance (1 Tim. 1:19–20; 2 Tim. 2:16–18; Titus 3:10–11)
  - No casual engagement with deceivers (Acts 20:30; Gal. 1:6–9)

#### Let Them Be Examined

- Elders and deacons must be scrutinized:
  - 1 Tim. 3:10; 1 Tim. 5:24–25
- Requirements of Titus 1:9 demand:
  - Mature faith
  - Firm grasp of doctrine
  - Boldness to silence error
- Neglect of examination leads to:
  - Dysfunctional elderships
  - Vulnerable churches
  - Doctrinal chaos

## **SHEPHERD GOD’S FLOCK IN GOD’S WAY**

---

### *Chapter 24* | ***1 Peter 5:1–5*** — Peter’s Exhortation and Encouragement to the Elders

#### _

- 1 Peter 5:1–2
- Peter’s role in early church leadership (Acts 1–12; Acts 15)
- Peter and Paul in agreement:
  - Elders must pastor the church of God
  - Plurality of elders affirmed
  - No singular “overseer” above elders
- Unique contribution:
  - Additional elder instructions
  - Promise of reward: “unfading crown of glory” (v. 4)

#### Peter to His Fellow Elders

- Addressed to elders in:
  - Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, Bithynia (1 Pet. 1:1)
- Written ca. AD 63 from Rome
- Peter calls elders to pastor willingly, eagerly, and as examples
- Eldership widespread:
  - Thomas Schreiner: elders “stretch over” the Greco-Roman world
  - Wayne Grudem: Peter assumes all churches had elders

##### Suffering, Persecution, and Judgment

- “So” (v.1) links exhortation to:
  - Fiery trials (1 Pet. 4:12–14, 16–17, 19)
  - Judgment beginning with house of God (1 Pet. 4:17)
  - Cf. Ezek. 9:6

- Believers as pilgrims need shepherds to guide through persecution
  - Leadership is under pressure (Peter Davids)

#### Peter’s Threefold Self-Description (1 Pet. 5:1)

##### “A Fellow Elder” (συμπρεσβύτερος [sympresbyteros])

- Indicates:
  - Affection
  - Solidarity
  - Humility
- Not a mere title: Peter actually served as an elder
  - Jerusalem persecution context
- Shared pastoral experience:
  - Front-line shepherd, not theoretical
  - 30+ years of shepherding

###### John the Elder

- Called himself “the elder” (2 John 1; 3 John 1)
- Likely reference to age and experience (cf. Philem. 9)

##### “A Witness of the Sufferings of Christ”

- Refers to suffering experienced by all believers (1 Pet. 2:21; 3:9; 4:14, 16; 5:9)
- Not mystical, but practical: following Christ’s example (J.R. Michaels)
- Acts: Peter beaten, jailed, persecuted
- Martyred ca. AD 65

##### “A Partaker in the Glory That Is Going to Be Revealed”

- Suffering precedes glory (1 Pet. 4:13)
- Shared reward at Christ’s appearing

#### Shepherd God’s Flock (vv. 1–2)

- Verb “exhort” = παρακαλέω (parakaleō)
- Verb “shepherd” = ποιμαίνω (poimainō) – imperative
- Echoes Prov. 27:23

##### Threefold Task of Shepherding:
- Provision
- Protection
- Guidance

- Jesus to Peter: “Feed…Shepherd…Feed my sheep” (John 21:15–17)
- Elders called to active, attentive shepherding

##### The Need for Exhortation

- Tendency toward:
  - Laziness
  - Minimal effort
- Elders need constant reminding (Acts 20:28–31; Ezek. 34:1–10; Jer. 10:21; Zech. 11:15, 17)

##### The Flock of God (ποίμνιον [poimnion])

- Valuable, precious, bought with Christ’s blood (Acts 20:28)
- Belongs to God, not elders (cf. Charles Cranfield)

#### Overseeing (ἐπισκοποῦντες [episkopountes])

- From episkopeō (see Acts 20:28; Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 3:1–2)
- Equivalent to shepherding
- Richer imagery: shepherding vs. overseeing
- Verbal form links elders and overseers

#### Overseeing God’s Flock God’s Way (vv. 2–3)

##### Not Under Compulsion

- Compulsion = reluctance (negative sense)
- Examples:
  - Pressure from spouse, friends, money
  - Trapped by circumstance
- Right model: volunteers, not drafted soldiers (Lenski)
- Willing service = “as God would have you”
  - Like Jesus (John 10:11)

##### Not for Shameful Gain, but Eagerly

- “Shameful gain” = αἰσχροκερδῶς [aischrokerdōs]
- Refers to:
  - Dishonest motives
  - Material greed (cf. Titus 1:7; 1 Tim. 3:3; Ezek. 34:2–3; Ezek. 22:27)
- Jesus: warns against hired hands (John 10:12–13)
- Paul’s example: Acts 20:33–34

- “Eagerly” = readily, zealously, enthusiastically
  - 1 Tim. 3:1: aspiring to a noble task
  - Eph. 5:25: loving the church sacrificially

##### Not Domineering over Those in Your Charge

- “Domineering” = κατακυριεύω [katakyrieuō]
  - Also used in Matt. 20:25; Mark 10:42
- Elders:
  - Not to be lords
  - Not to rule harshly (Ezek. 34:4)
  - Diotrephes condemned (3 John 9–10)

##### People Assigned by God

- “Those in your charge” = κλήρων [klērōn] – “portions,” “allotments”
- Flock assigned by God to elders’ care
- Not possessions, but stewardship

##### Role Models for the People

- Elders lead by example (v. 3)
- Ancient shepherds walked ahead of the flock (Peter Davids)
- Jesus = supreme example (1 Pet. 2:21)
- Paul: imitators of me (1 Cor. 11:1; Phil. 3:17)
- If elders are holy, humble, mission-minded—so will the people be

#### The Future Reward for Christ’s Undershepherds (v. 4)

##### Chief Shepherd (ἀρχιποίμην [archipoimēn])

- Jesus = one Shepherd (John 10:11, 14, 16; Heb. 13:20; 1 Pet. 2:25)
- Undershepherds:
  - Serve under Christ’s authority
  - Accountable for obedience to him
  - I. Howard Marshall: “leadership of Christ under His direction”

##### The Appearing of the Chief Shepherd

- Motivation: appearing of Christ
- Hope for reward in trials
- Rev. 7:17 – shepherding into eternity

##### The Crown of Glory

- “Unfading” – unlike earthly crowns
- Crown = metaphor; glory = reality
- Genitive of apposition
- Christ’s glory, not man’s
- Public reward for sacrificial shepherds
- Debated meaning:
  - Eternal life
  - Special honor
  - Or both

#### Younger Members Be Subject to the Elders (v. 5)

- “Likewise” connects with vv. 1–4
- Likely refers to official elders, not just older men

##### Be Subject to the Elders

- Necessary for proper shepherding
- Submission = Christian virtue
  - 1 Pet. 3:1, 5 (wives)
  - 1 Pet. 2:18 (servants)
  - 1 Pet. 2:13 (citizens)

##### Younger (νεώτεροι [neōteroi])

- Possibly young men:
  - Often eager, impatient, ambitious (Acts 5:6; Titus 2:6–8; 1 Tim. 5:1–2)
- Early Church warnings:
  - Polycarp: obedience to presbyters
  - 1 Clement: Corinthian rebellion against elders

- Peter Davids:
  - Youth = energy, but impatience
  - Risk to church under persecution

#### Clothe Yourselves with Humility (v. 5)

- Solution to intergenerational tension
- Pride = destruction (Prov. 16:18)
- Only humility ensures peace and unity
  - Thomas Schreiner: “Humility is the oil...”

- Elders: lead humbly (Acts 20:19)
- Jesus: exalted the humble (Matt. 23:12)
- Prov. 3:34 (LXX): “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble”

## **PRAYING FOR THE SICK**

---

### *Chapter 25* | ***James 5:13–15*** — If Sick: Call the Elders of the Church

#### _

- James 5:14
- Author: James, the Lord’s brother (Gal. 1:19)
- Leader in Jerusalem church (Acts 15:13–21; 21:17–25)
- Letter addressed: “To the twelve tribes in the Dispersion” (James 1:1)
- Written ca. AD 45–48
- One of the earliest references to Christian elders (cf. Acts 11:30)

#### Call for the Elders

- The call to prayer:
  - Begins and ends the letter (James 1:5–7; 5:13–18)
  - A key Christian practice (R. V. G. Tasker)
  - The prayer of a righteous person is powerful (James 5:16)

##### Three Life Categories (v. 13)

- Suffering → Let him pray
- Cheerful → Let him sing praise
- Sick → Let him call for the elders of the church

#### Physical Sickness or Spiritual Weakness?

- Greek “sick” = ἀσθενέω (*astheneō*)
  - Can mean weakness in conscience/spiritual health (e.g. Rom. 14:1–2; 1 Thess. 5:14)
  - But commonly used for physical illness in Gospels and Acts

- Greek “sick” in v.15 = κάμνω (*kamnō*)
  - Means weary, fatigued, or sick (cf. Heb. 12:3)

- Context supports physical sickness:
  - Elders are called *to* the person, implying bedridden condition
  - “Pray over him” (ἐπ᾽ αὐτόν [ep auton]) implies a downward posture
  - Anointing with oil associated with healing (Mark 6:13)
  - “If he has committed sins” suggests sin is a possible, not assumed cause
  - The prayer of faith “saves” (σῴζω [sōzō]), “raises up” (ἐγείρω [egeirō]), “heals” (ἰάομαι [iaomai])

- Majority of modern translations render *astheneō* as “sick”

#### A Special Call for Prayer

- Bedridden believer → requires special prayer and care
- “Let him call” = imperative verb → active faith action
- Most people do not call elders due to lack of teaching/practice
  - Simon Kistemaker: such practice seen as “bygone”

##### Elders Plural

- “Elders of the church” not priest, pastor, deacon, or healer
- A recognized body of elders expected
- Prayer as a joint effort of governing elders
- Elders = spiritual leaders, caregivers, not miracle workers

#### Let the Elders Pray and Anoint with Oil

- Prayer = main action in the passage (used 7 times in vv. 13–18)
- Scene:
  - Elders gather, stand or kneel, pray over sick person
  - Not necessarily laying on of hands
- Personal presence enhances prayer
  - Thomas Manton: sight of sick deepens intercession
  - R. V. G. Tasker: bedside prayer strengthens faith of sick
  - C. L. Mitton: personal prayer > remote prayer

#### Anointing with Oil

- Participial phrase “anointing with oil” accompanies prayer
- Oil not described in detail; assumed familiar to Jewish audience

##### Biblical Background

- OT uses:
  - Sacred anointing of people/objects (Ex. 29:2, 21; 30:30; Gen. 28:18; 31:13)
  - Kings anointed for service (1 Sam. 10:1; 1 Kings 1:39)
- No NT concept of "sacred oil"—James speaks of ordinary olive oil

##### Symbolism of Oil

- Physical action with spiritual meaning
- Comforting gesture for the sick
- Reminds of God’s presence and concern
- Possibly symbolic of Holy Spirit’s empowering (Zech. 4:6)
- Done “in the name of the Lord” (Acts 3:6, 16; 4:10)

##### Medicinal vs. Symbolic Use

- Oil used medicinally in ancient world (Luke 10:34; Isa. 1:6)
- But James likely not prescribing medicine—he assumes medicine already applied
- Elders are not physicians

##### Mark 6:13

- Apostles anointed sick with oil
- Likely symbolic, not medicinal—Jesus gave them power to heal all diseases (Matt. 10:1)

##### Aleiphō vs. Chriō

- Aleiphō (ἀλείφω): physical anointing
- Chriō (χρίω): religious, ceremonial anointing
- Both used for priestly anointing in LXX (Ex. 40:13–15; Num. 3:3)
- Josephus uses interchangeably (Antiquities 6.157, 6.165)
- Douglas Moo: James uses *aleiphō* as common physical anointing

##### The Name

- Oil applied “in the name of the Lord”
- Power is not in oil or elders, but in Jesus Christ
- Acts done under his authority and for his glory

#### The Prayer of Faith (v. 15)

- “The prayer of faith will save the one who is sick”
- “The Lord will raise him up”
- Healing as seen in Gospels due to faith-filled intercession (Matt. 8:5–13; 9:18–26)

##### Characteristics of Prayer of Faith

- Sincere, unwavering trust (James 1:5–8)
- Belief in God’s goodness (Rom. 8:28)
- Confidence in God’s compassion (James 5:11)
- Offered according to God’s will (1 John 5:14–15)

- Worldly, prayerless elders cannot offer it (James 4:3)
- Elders must be men of deep prayer and trust

##### Absolute Promises?

- James uses strong language, similar to Jesus (Matt. 21:22; John 14:13–14; Mark 11:24)
- Not intended as blank checks:
  - Jesus taught: “not as I will, but as you will” (Matt. 26:39)
  - James: “If the Lord wills…” (James 4:15)

##### Biblical Examples

- Paul’s “thorn in the flesh” not removed (2 Cor. 12:7–9)
- Epaphroditus’ recovery = God’s mercy, not a miracle (Phil. 2:27)
- Healing not always dramatic or immediate
- James gives general instruction, not formulaic outcome

#### Dealing with Sin (v. 15)

- “If he has committed sins, he will be forgiven”
- Sin may cause sickness (1 Cor. 11:30–32; Heb. 12:5–11; John 15:1–8)

##### Sins Among the Recipients

- Jealousy, ambition (3:14)
- Quarreling (4:1–2)
- Worldliness (4:1–3)
- Discrimination (2:1–13)
- Complaining (4:11; 5:9)
- Lack of faith (1:22–27; 2:14–26)

##### Elders’ Role

- May need to counsel, hear confession, guide restoration
- Spiritual healing accompanies physical healing

##### Not All Sickness = Sin

- Job’s suffering disproves this (Job 1–2)
- “If” clause shows possibility, not certainty
- Devout believers can suffer (Thomas Manton)

##### Paul’s Infirmity

- Became divine guidance (Gal. 4:13–14)
- If “thorn” = illness → sanctifying, protective (2 Cor. 12:7–10)

- Elders must be prepared to discern and counsel wisely

#### Conclusion

- Command is clear:
  - The sick are to call the elders
  - The elders are to pray and anoint with oil
- Obedience brings comfort, counsel, and potential healing
- One clear instruction from God is sufficient—no repetition needed

---

## **LOVING, HONORING, AND OBEYING THE ELDERS**

---

### *Chapter 26* | ***1 Thessalonians 5:12–13*** — Esteem the Elders Highly

#### _

- Text: 1 Thessalonians 5:12–13
- Context:
  - Elders not named directly, but leadership roles clearly described
  - Paul, Silas, Timothy visited Thessalonica (Acts 17:1–9, AD 49)
  - Church founded recently; missionaries forced to depart early
  - Paul writes letter from Corinth several months later
- Congregational leadership:
  - Some men began functioning as spiritual leaders
  - Likely Spirit-gifted volunteers (not formally appointed elders)
  - May have included converted Jews or devout Greeks (Acts 17:2–4)
  - Majority of church: former pagan Gentiles (1 Thess. 1:9)

#### Why This Passage Applies to Eldership

1. Describes plurality of leaders
2. Activities (laboring, leading, admonishing) match those of elders (1 Tim. 5:17; Acts 20:31, 35)
3. Leaders to be honored — similar to “double honor” in 1 Tim. 5:17; Heb. 13:17
4. Paul’s practice: formally appoint elders on return visits (Acts 14:23)
5. Holy Spirit gifts men as overseers/shepherds (1 Thess. 1:5; 5:19–20; Acts 20:28)
6. No contradiction with Paul’s elder teaching — rather, complements it

#### Acknowledge Your Leaders

##### “We ask you, brothers...”

- Term “brothers” used 17× in letter
- Reflects family identity; mutual respect, not hierarchy
- Appeals to whole congregation, not just leaders

##### Community Responsibility

- Verses surrounded by "one another" commands:
  - Encourage one another (v. 11)
  - Do good to one another (v. 15)
- Church-wide engagement, not top-down structure

#### Paul’s Appeal to Acknowledge the Leaders

##### “Respect” = οἶδα (*oida*)

- Possible translations:
  - Respect (ESV)
  - Acknowledge (NIV, NASB, NKJV)
  - Recognize (alternative)
- Gordon Fee: “recognize their leadership activities”
- Jeffrey Weima: distinction between "acknowledge" and "respect" minimal

##### Historical Considerations

- No clergy-laity distinction at this time
- No titles or garments to signify authority
- Likely unpaid service → easy to overlook
- Not one prominent figure, but multiple leaders
- See 1 Cor. 16:16–18: similar encouragement to honor and submit to faithful workers

#### The Three Activities of These Leaders

- All governed by a single article τοὺς (*tous*) and joined with καί (*kai*)
- One group described with three participles:
  - Laboring
  - Leading
  - Admonishing

##### Plurality Emphasized

- Plural participles indicate multiple leaders
- James Denney: no single president, but a group of laborers

#### Acknowledge Those Who Labor Among You

- Verb: κοπιάω (*kopiaō*) = strenuous, exhausting labor
- Common in Paul’s vocabulary for ministry
- Also used in:
  - 1 Tim. 5:17 — elders laboring in preaching and teaching
  - Acts 20:34–35 — Paul’s example to Ephesian elders

##### Description of the Labor

- Likely bivocational (1 Thess. 2:9; 2 Thess. 3:6–10)
- Included:
  - Teaching Scripture
  - Praying with the sick
  - Helping the weak
  - Offering wise counsel
  - Visiting homes
  - Evangelizing
  - Comforting in persecution

#### Acknowledge Those Who Lead You

- Verb: προΐστημι (*proistēmi*) = to lead, preside, govern, care for

##### Translation Variants

- “Are over you” (ESV, NKJV)
- “Lead you” (CSB)
- “Care for you” (NIV)
- “Have charge over you” (NRSVue)

##### NT Usage

- Leading the household (1 Tim. 3:4)
- Elders ruling well (1 Tim. 5:17)
- Spiritual gift (Rom. 12:8)
- Devotion to good works (Titus 3:8, 14)

##### Leadership Emphasized

- Fits context: recognition of leaders
- Not mere caretaking, but directional authority
- Still includes care and protection

##### “In the Lord”

- Authority is spiritual, not civil
- Done under Christ’s rule, not personal dominion
- Leon Morris: not cold authority, but familial responsibility

#### Acknowledge Those Who Admonish You

- Verb: νουθετέω (*noutheteō*) = to warn, correct, reprove gently
- Ethical/moral emphasis
- Often paired with teaching
- Not harsh scolding — “big-brotherly” correction (Leon Morris)

##### Purpose of Admonition

- Protect, correct, mature the flock (cf. Acts 20:31)
- Indispensable to true spiritual leadership

##### James Denney on Admonition

- Church members will carry worldly baggage
- Admonition necessary to maintain Christian character
- Should be received as love, not resented

##### Consequences of Neglect

- Leaders afraid of losing members or money → fail in duty
- Result: spiritual weakness, loss of biblical integrity

#### Esteem and Love Your Leaders

##### “Esteem them very highly”

- Verb: ἡγέομαι (*hēgeomai*) = to consider, think of
- Adverb: ὑπερεκπερισσου̂ (*hyperekperissou*) = most exceedingly, superabundantly

##### Commentators:

- George Findlay: strongest possible Greek intensity
- Jeffrey Weima: double prefix = highest comparison form
- William Hendriksen: “esteem like an overflowing ocean”

##### Not Optional

- Esteem and love for leaders is a scriptural obligation
- Not based on personality, but on their labor

##### God Cares

- God's concern for honoring civil leaders (Rom. 13:7; 1 Pet. 2:17)
- Paul apologizes for disrespecting high priest (Acts 23:5)
- How much more for spiritual leaders!

##### Our Natural Tendency

- Ingratitude, criticism, complaining
- Israel rejected Moses, David
- Scripture commands: honor those who work hard

#### “In Love”

- Not just obedience, but affection
- Love unifies church through inevitable tension and failure
- 1 Thess. 4:9–10: excel more in brotherly love

##### Francis Schaeffer:

- Real issue often isn’t doctrine, but absence of love
- Bitterness from unloving words lingers decades

##### Love as Practical Covering

- Love believes the best
- Love is less critical, more gracious
- Love = best gift to leaders (1 Cor. 13:4; 1 Pet. 4:8)

#### “Because of Their Work”

- Esteem due to labor, not titles or personalities
- Their service includes:
  - Counseling
  - Conflict resolution
  - Sin confrontation
  - Spiritual maturity work
- Nearly overwhelmed Moses (Num. 11:10–15)

##### Leon Morris:

- Leaders deserve love not because of status, but work

##### Effective Leadership Demands Effective Following

- People’s attitudes impact leaders’ effectiveness
- Esteeming leaders helps them serve joyfully

#### A Call to Peace

- “Be at peace among yourselves” — imperative
- Peace = shared responsibility, not just leaders'
- Every member contributes to church climate
- We are God's “peace corps” (Rom. 14:19; Mark 9:50)

##### Peacemaking Requires:

- Intentionality
- Energy
- Sacrifice
- Without it, churches fracture

##### Especially in Hostile World

- External persecution → internal unity essential (1 Thessalonica’s context)

#### Conclusion

- Paul’s message is clear:
  - Acknowledge and esteem your leaders highly
  - Do so in love, because of their labor
  - Maintain peace in the body of Christ
- John Eadie: obedience to these commands = peace and prosperity of the church

### *Chapter 27* | ***Hebrews 13:17*** — They Keep Watch Over Your Souls

#### _
- Hebrews 13:17
- Author unknown, but clearly a:
  - Skilled teacher of Scripture
  - Watchful shepherd
  - Proactive leader
- Displays the supremacy of Christ (Heb. 1:2–4)

#### Imitate Your Former Leaders (Hebrews 13:7)
- “Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God.”
- Three instructions:
  - **Remember**:
    - Former leaders who proclaimed the gospel
    - Taught a Christ-centered, word-based message
    - In contrast to ritual-centered teachings (Heb. 13:9)
  - **Consider**:
    - “The outcome of their way of life”
    - Examine: accomplishments, conduct, priorities, endurance, holiness
    - Compare to heroes of faith (Heb. 11)
  - **Imitate**:
    - Their **faith** and **faithfulness**
    - Not passive nostalgia—active emulation
    - Remedy to false teaching and spiritual drift

#### Obey and Submit to Your Leaders (Hebrews 13:17)
- Strong double imperative:
  - “**Obey** your leaders” (πείθω *peithō*)
    - Also translated as “have confidence” (NIV)
  - “**Submit** to them” (ὑπείκω *hypeikō*)
    - Only NT use
    - Means “yield to authority”
- Submission themes in the NT:
  - Rom. 16:19; 2 Cor. 2:9; Phil. 2:12; Philem. 21
  - James 4:7; 1 Pet. 1:14–15; Eph. 5:18–21
- Elders must also be:
  - Submitted to Christ (Heb. 13:20; 1 Pet. 5:2–4)
  - Obedient stewards (Titus 1:7)
  - Mutually submissive to one another
- Congregational followership:
  - Vital to healthy church life
  - Bad example: Israel under Moses (Heb. 3:16–4:16)
  - Example of church collapse due to defiance

##### False Leadership Warning
- Submission is **not** blind obedience:
  - Paul rebukes Corinthians for tolerating abusive “super-apostles” (2 Cor. 11:19–21)
  - Elders must be publicly rebuked if sinning (1 Tim. 5:20–22)
  - Elders are **not above accountability**

#### Watchmen of Souls

##### They Keep Watch (Heb. 13:17)
- Reason for obedience: “they are keeping watch over your souls”
- Greek: ἀγρυπνέω (*agrypneō*) = “stay awake,” “be alert,” “watchful”
- Leaders must be:
  - Spiritually vigilant
  - Alert to danger
  - Emotionally invested, even sleepless

##### The Souls of God’s People
- Greek: ψυχή (*psychē*) = “soul,” “self,” “life”
  - Can be translated as “you” (NIV)
  - But likely points to **eternal** spiritual welfare
- Possible implication: leaders who reported church issues to the author

#### Giving an Account to God
- Leaders must “give an account” (Heb. 13:17)
- Judgment Seat passages:
  - 2 Cor. 5:10; Rom. 14:12; 1 Cor. 3:13–15; Heb. 4:13
- Teachers judged more strictly (James 3:1)
- Illustration:
  - Watchmen on city wall
  - Shepherds guarding sheep
- Richard Lenski: anyone with responsibility for **even one soul** is accountable

#### Make Their Work Joyful, Not Grief-Filled

##### Joy in Leadership
- Congregational obedience leads to:
  - Joy for leaders (Phil. 4:1; 3 John 4)
  - Harmony and gospel growth
  - Shared fulfillment in Christ

##### Groaning in Leadership
- Disobedience causes:
  - Groaning (στενάζω, *stenazō*)
  - Emotional burden, grief, exhaustion
  - Exodus example: Moses' plea for death (Num. 11:14–15)
  - Paul: tears and heartache (2 Cor. 2:3)

##### Litotes: “That would be of no advantage to you”
- Understated warning; implies:
  - Serious spiritual consequences
  - Possible divine discipline (1 Cor. 11:29–34)
  - Satanic deception (2 Cor. 11:3)
  - Hardened, bitter spirit
- William Lane: church health is tied to members’ response to leaders

#### Greet All Your Leaders (Hebrews 13:24)
- “Greet all your leaders and all the saints”
- Threefold use of “all”:
  - Inclusive of entire leadership team and church body
- Highlights:
  - Plurality of leadership
  - Anonymous, Christ-centered authorship
  - Ends with exaltation of Jesus

---

#### Benediction (Hebrews 13:20–21)

> “Now may the God of peace who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of the eternal covenant, equip you with everything good that you may do his will, working in us that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.”

### *Chapter 28* | Understanding the Relationship between the Elders and the Congregation

#### _
- Begins with the congregation, not the elders
  - Eldership without a congregation is meaningless
    - A congregation can exist without elders (Titus 1:5; Acts 14:23)
  - Elders must understand the nature of the church
  - Holy Spirit calls them to shepherd “the church of God” (Acts 20:28)

- A disciple of Christ
- A brother/sister in God’s family (Rom. 8:29; 1 Pet. 5:9)

##### Key truths:
- Every-member ministry is essential
- Every believer is part of a Spirit-filled global family

#### Addressing the Whole Congregation
- Paul addresses churches as a whole (Phil. 1:1)
- Elders and deacons are rarely mentioned again in the letter
- Hebrews: congregation exhorted to submit to leaders (Heb. 13:17)
- Peter:
  - All believers are to serve one another (1 Pet. 4:10–11)
    - Elders to shepherd and younger to submit (1 Pet. 5:2, 5)
  - Pastoral Epistles: written with whole congregations in view (1 Tim. 6:21; Titus 3:15)

#### The Whole Church Acting
- Acts: churches corporately
  - Sent messengers (Acts 11:22)
    - Gave funds, received missionaries
    - Chose representatives
    - Wrote letters of commendation

#### Elders and Members Alike
- Many elder duties also apply to members
  - Guard truth (Rom. 16:17–18)
    - Help the weak (Titus 3:14)
    - Be hospitable (1 Pet. 4:9)
    - Teach others (Rom. 15:14; Col. 3:16)
  - Elders: officially accountable overseers (Acts 20:28; Heb. 13:17)
- Mutual cooperation is essential
  - Collaborative, not dictatorial

#### WHAT THE SCRIPTURE SAYS ABOUT THE ELDERS’ POSITION AND AUTHORITY
1. Appointed by the Holy Spirit (Acts 20:28)
2. Occupy “office of overseer” (1 Tim. 3:1)
3. Undershepherds of Christ (1 Pet. 5:1–5)
4. Exercise oversight (1 Pet. 5:2)
5. Must not lord authority (1 Pet. 5:3)
6. Lead the church (1 Tim. 5:17; 1 Thess. 5:12)
7. Manage God’s household (1 Tim. 3:4–5)
8. Stewards of God’s house (Titus 1:7)
9. Teach and guard doctrine (Acts 20:28–31; Titus 1:9)
10. Keep watch over souls (Heb. 13:17)
11. Form the “council of elders” (1 Tim. 4:14)
12. Must be mature, qualified, examined men (Titus 1:9)

#### The Eldership’s Authority
- Elders are:
  - Spirit-placed overseers (Acts 20:28)
    - God’s stewards (Titus 1:7)
    - The pastoral leadership body (1 Tim. 4:14)
  - Congregation is to obey elders (Heb. 13:17)

#### Christlike Use of Authority
- Elders must:
  - Govern like Christ
    - Be servant leaders (Eph. 5:22–27)
    - Be accountable to Scripture
    - Remain brothers, not a clerical caste

#### Servants, not Rulers
- “Elder rule” is a misnomer
  - Elders are never called “rulers” (archōn)
    - Elders are servants (2 Cor. 1:24; 4:5)
  - Paul’s model: authority with humility (Phil. 1:25; Gal. 5:23)
- Elders are not immune to accountability (Acts 11:2–18; Gal. 2:11–14)

#### WHAT SCRIPTURE SAYS ABOUT THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CHURCH TO ELDERS
1. Submit and obey (Heb. 13:17)
2. Younger members subject to elders (1 Pet. 5:5)
3. Be subject to servant-leaders (1 Cor. 16:15–16)

10. Everyone is responsible for doctrinal purity (Gal. 3:1; Jude 3)
11. Imitate their lives (Heb. 13:7)

#### Submission, not Passivity
- Not blind or uncritical
- Congregation must hold elders accountable
- Scripture is the final authority

#### ELDERS AND CONGREGATION WORKING TOGETHER
- Tensions may arise—seek peace (1 Thess. 5:13)
- Elders must:
  - Equip the saints
    - Communicate openly
    - Involve congregation in major decisions

#### Examples of NT Cooperation

##### Acts 6:1–7 – Solving a Crisis
- Apostles
  - Called whole church
    - Proposed solution
    - Let church select the Seven
    - Laid hands on them

##### Acts 15 – Solving a Doctrinal Dispute
- Apostles + elders debated and decided
- Whole church affirmed outcome (Acts 15:22, 27)

##### Matthew 18:15–20 – Church Discipline
- Three-step process
  - Final step: “tell it to the church”
  - Elders’ involvement implied
- Requires wise oversight, protection of privacy
- Discipline must be loving and firm (2 Cor. 2:5–11)
- Unrepentance = binding; repentance = loosing (Matt. 18:18)
- Corinth example:
  - Refusal to discipline = infection (1 Cor. 5)
    - Restoration requires forgiveness (2 Cor. 2:6–7)

#### Examining Elder Qualifications
- Elders and congregation share the process
- Public, not private, process (1 Tim. 3:10; 5:24–25)
- Use forms/questionnaires with biblical qualifications
- Weigh mature input more heavily
- Elders investigate valid objections
- Obedience to Scripture trumps popular opinion

#### Final Reflections
- Elders declare candidates qualified
- Elders officially install
- Major decisions: elders lead, congregation participates
- Biblically qualified eldership is God’s design
  - Plurality
    - Parity
    - Diversity
    - Maturity
    - Accountability
    - Scriptural fidelity
    - Spiritual discernment (Titus 1:9)

### *Chapter 29* | Making Pastoral Eldership Work

#### _
- Pastoral eldership requires intentional effort, not just structural formality
  - Biblical success in eldership, like marriage or church discipline, requires
      - Holy Spirit motivation
        - Firm biblical convictions
        - Practical effort
        - Prayer
      - Shared pastoral leadership is biblical, but not self-operating
      - Creates its own challenges despite sound theology
    - A biblically structured church consists of
  - A plurality of scripturally qualified overseers
    - Laboring together
      - With genuine parity
        - With harmonious, functional diversity
    - Goal of chapter: practical ways to make pastoral eldership effective

#### A FLEXIBLE AND ADAPTABLE STRUCTURE
- Eldership must adapt to local context (size, location, giftedness)
  - Because the church is a global movement (Matt. 28:19)
    - Scripture allows creative freedom in church procedures, but within biblical boundaries

##### Size of the Congregation
- Smaller church (e.g. 40 people)
  - Elders know everyone personally
    - Strong family feel
    - High relational input
    - More interactive teaching
    - May not need full-time elders
  - Larger church (e.g. 2,000 people)
  - Requires complex structure
      - May have 25 elders
        - Use of executive councils, subcommittees
      - Staff includes full-time and part-time elders
    - Elders often know only a portion of the members
    - Higher organization and specialization

##### Location of the Church
- Rural setting
  - Informal, familial tone
    - Churches are smaller
    - Members more self-sufficient and homogeneous
  - Urban/suburban setting
  - Churches are multicultural and complex
    - Higher demands on elders
    - Teaching/pulpit ministry must meet high expectations
    - Greater variety of programs required

##### Giftedness
- Each elder contributes his unique gifting
- Types of eldership teams
  - Highly gifted team
    - Team with a standout global teacher
    - Average or moderately gifted team
    - Team with no particularly gifted leaders—still responsible to shepherd
  - Compensation decisions based on giftedness (1 Tim. 5:17–18)

##### Key Principle
- NT flexibility is intentional
  - No clerical caste allowed
    - Elders remain brothers, not priests

#### WORKING TOGETHER IN HARMONY
- Internal team health is essential
  - Conflict among elders is common
    - Elders must commit to:
      - Humility
        - Servanthood
        - Brotherly equality
        - Forgiveness
        - Gentleness
        - Self-sacrificing love (cf. Chapter 1)
 
   ##### Working Together as a Team of Brothers
- Danger: self-seeking leaders like James & John (Mark 10:35–45)
- Danger: Diotrephes-like leadership (3 John 9–10)
- Solution:
  - Submit to one another
    - Defer, consider, and love one another
    - Peter’s exhortations (1 Pet. 4:8; 3:8)

##### Resources for Conflict
- *If You Bite and Devour One Another* – biblical principles for handling conflict
- Second resource: Effective elders’ meetings

#### ORGANIZATION AND COMMUNICATION
- Elders are God's administrators (Titus 1:7)
- Danger of mismanagement, poor delegation, disorganization

##### Communication
- Elders must avoid secrecy
  - No surprise decisions
    - Church = close-knit family
    - Leadership = participatory (Acts 6; Acts 15)

##### Clarifying Responsibilities
- Models
  - Elder over 10 families
    - Elders over ministry areas
      - Youth
        - Deacons & visitation
        - Evangelism and missions
        - Doctrinal oversight
        - Teacher development
    - Confidentiality is essential (Prov. 25:9–10)

##### Elder Job Descriptions
- Prevents
  - Role confusion
    - Overlaps
    - Neglect (e.g. hospital visits)
  - Must be reviewed and updated

##### Administrator
- Especially needed in large churches
- Oversees programs and staff
- May be elder or not
- Works under elder oversight (1 Tim. 5:17; Titus 1:7)

##### Full-Time, Church-Supported Teachers
- Spirit-gifted teachers grow the church
- Compensated with “double honor” (1 Tim. 5:17–18)
- Eldership provides mutual accountability
- Local policy governs pulpit frequency
- Elders supervise paid staff
  - Ensure harmony with part-time elders
    - Promote humility (1 Pet. 5:5)

#### THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ELDERS’ MEETINGS
- Elders’ meetings are vital
  - Affect spiritual health of the church
    - Place of cohesion, clarity, communication

##### Accountability
- Protects against:
  - Laziness
    - Procrastination
    - Forgetfulness
  - Promotes:
  - Regular reporting
    - Mutual assistance
    - King David’s spirit (Ps. 141:5)

##### Making Friends and Building Relationships
- Fellowship is essential for unity
- Include spouses for relational health
- Neil Summerton: build trust with prayer, fellowship, no agenda

#### THE ELDER’S WIFE
- Partner in life and ministry
- Influences husband's effectiveness and reputation (Prov. 31:10–12, 23)
- Involved in:
  - Counseling
    - Hospitality
    - Encouragement
  - Peter: relationship with wife affects prayer life (1 Pet. 3:7)
- Ministry involvement varies by gifting, energy, season of life

#### TRAINING ELDERS
- Critical to healthy eldership
- Training modeled by Jesus and Paul
  - Great Commission (Matt. 28:19–20)
    - Paul taught Ephesian elders “whole counsel of God” (Acts 20:27)

##### Teaching the Elders the Whole Counsel of God
- Includes entire biblical narrative and doctrine
- Forms theological foundation

##### On-the-Job Training
- Elders learned by being with Paul
- Paul’s model: “imitate me” (1 Cor. 11:1; Phil. 3:17)
- *Trellis and the Vine*: Discipleship is relational and imitative

##### Teaching the Teachers
- 2 Tim. 2:2
  - Train reliable men
    - Must be able to teach
    - Timothy's mission: multiply teachers

##### Equipping the Equippers
- Eph. 4:11–12
  - Teachers prepare all saints
    - Train future teachers/shepherds

##### Shepherd Work
- Elders must proactively seek and train future elders
- Candidate readiness
  - Trained
    - Observed
    - Spiritually mature
    - Congregationally known

##### Be a Lifelong Learner
- Grow in grace and knowledge (2 Pet. 3:18)
- Mary’s example (Luke 10:39)
- Spiritual stagnation kills eldership
- Helpful resources:
  - Books, blogs, digital media
    - Formal education (seminary or online)
  - Scripture is core (2 Tim. 3:16–17)
  - Recommended focus: Romans

#### The Question of Specific Term Limits for Elders
- Term limits are discouraged
  - Undermine elder equality
    - Separate lay and full-time elders
    - Implies elder is temporary, pastor is boss
  - John Murray:
  - No NT warrant for term eldership
    - It disrupts continuity and responsibility
  - Sabbaticals encouraged

#### A Failed Model: Don’t Follow!
- First Church of the City (ch. 15) example
  - No prayer
    - No qualification assessment
    - No training
    - Result: unbiblical, disobedient practice

#### Conclusion
- God honors recovery of biblical teaching
- Call to restore biblical eldership
  - Plurality
    - Qualification
    - Spirit-placed leadership
  - Apostolic instruction: Titus 1:5
  - “Put what remained into order, and appoint elders in every town”

        - **Leading** (through trials)
        - **Caring** (practical needs)
        - Emphasis: Eldership is **pastoral**, not just executive (_Ch. 2, 9, 10_)
    15. Plurality of **elders = overseers** (_Phil. 1:1, Ch. 11_)
16. “Overseer” (episkopos):
    - **Functional role**: supervision, management

#### Church Officers
17. **Deacons** serve as assistants to elders (_Ch. 11_)
18. Only two official roles:
    - **Elders/overseers**
        - **Deacons**
        - No senior pastor/ordained bishop roles (_Ch. 11_)

#### Qualifications & Appointment
19. NT emphasizes **moral and spiritual qualifications** most (_Ch. 4, 12–13_)

    22. **All-male eldership**
    - Controversial, but biblical (_1 Tim. 2:8–3:13, Ch. 5_)
    23. Must be **publicly examined**
    - Many churches fail at this critical process (_1 Tim. 3:10, Ch. 15, 28_)
    24. “Council of elders” (1 Tim. 4:14)
    - **Commissioned Timothy** (_Ch. 15_)

25. Elders vary in:
    - **Gifts, knowledge, availability, experience**
        - Yet share same office and title (_Ch. 3, 17_)
    26. Elders laboring in **teaching/preaching** deserve **double honor** (_1 Tim. 5:17–18, Ch. 16–17_)
27. Not all have same gift or proficiency in teaching
    - Still no **special titles** (_Ch. 17_)

#### Accountability & Discipline
28. Congregation protects elders from **slander** (_1 Tim. 5:19, Ch. 18_)
29. Persistently sinning elders:
    - Publicly rebuked (_1 Tim. 5:20, Ch. 18_)
    30. Congregation must act **impartially** in discipline (_1 Tim. 5:21, Ch. 19_)
31. Avoid **hasty appointments** to eldership (_1 Tim. 5:22, Ch. 19_)

    35. Must hold firmly to **gospel truths** (_Titus 1:9, Ch. 23_)
36. Must instruct and rebuke as needed (_Titus 1:9, Ch. 23_)

#### Peter’s Exhortation
37. Elders are **undershepherds** of Christ (_1 Pet. 5:2, 4, Ch. 24_)
38. Oversight must be:
    - **Willing**
        - **Eager**
        - **By example**, not compulsion (_1 Pet. 5:2–3, Ch. 24_)
    39. Promise of reward:
    - **Unfading crown of glory** (_1 Pet. 5:4, Ch. 24_)
    40. Lead in **humility**, or cause division (_Ch. 24_)
41. Only elders charged to **shepherd** local flocks (_Ch. 9, 24_)

#### Misconceptions & Priorities
42. Common excuse: “No time” for elders to serve
    - Real issue: **false priorities** (_Ch. 2_)
    43. In illness, call the elders for prayer/anointing
    - Provide counsel if sin is involved (_James 5:14–15, Ch. 25_)

#### Thessalonian Example
44. Elders labored to correct and lead (_1 Thess. 5:12–13, Ch. 26_)
45. Congregation to **esteem and love** elders highly (_Ch. 26_)
46. Both must strive for **peace** (_Ch. 26_)

#### Spiritual Watchmen
47. Elders are accountable before God (_Heb. 13:17, Ch. 27_)
48. Rejected counsel = loss of spiritual blessing (_Ch. 27_)

#### Elder-Congregation Relationship
49. Relationship involves:
    - **Tensions and ambiguities**
        - Elders organize for **unity and cooperation** (_Ch. 28_)
    50. Plurality isn’t enough—**effectiveness** is required (_Ch. 29_)
51. Elders must establish:
    - **Sound organization**
        - **Clear communication**
        - Avoid disorganization (_Titus 1:7, Ch. 29_)
    52. **Training is essential**
    - Discipleship = teaching + modeling (_Ch. 29_)

#### Final Summary
53. God’s governing structure:
    - **Plural, Spirit-placed, qualified elders**
        - Function in **parity and diversity**
        - “Council of elders” (1 Tim. 4:14)
        - Confirmed by many NT passages:
          - Acts 14:23
            - Acts 15:2–16:4
            - Acts 20:17–38
