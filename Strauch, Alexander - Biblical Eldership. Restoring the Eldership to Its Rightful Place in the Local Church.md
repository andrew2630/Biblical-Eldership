---

### **Three Key Features of a Biblical Eldership**

---

#### **A. Pastoral Leadership by Elders**
##### 1. Central Tenet
- Eldership is **inherently pastoral** in nature
- Rooted in apostolic teaching and modeled after Christ

##### 2. Apostolic Instruction
- **Paul to Ephesian Elders** (Acts 20:28, CSB)
   - a. *“Be on guard… overseers… to shepherd the church of God…”*
   - b. The Holy Spirit places elders in the flock for **pastoral care**
   - c. The flock is purchased with Christ’s own blood
- **Peter to Elders in Asia Minor** (1 Pet. 5:1–2)
   - a. *“Shepherd the flock of God that is among you…”*
   - b. Elders exercise oversight
   - c. Elders are **uniquely charged** with shepherding—no other group shares this mandate

##### 3. Pastoral Responsibility Defined
- Elders are assigned **pastoral oversight** of specific, individual flocks
- Supported in their work by **qualified deacons**
   - a. See: Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 3:8–13
   - b. Explored further in Chapter 11

##### 4. Nature of Shepherd Leadership
- Contrasted with corporate/business leadership models
- Encompasses:
   - a. Teaching Scripture
   - b. Protecting from false teachers
   - c. Evangelizing
   - d. Counseling
   - e. Caring for practical needs
   - f. Living among the flock as **Christlike examples**

##### 5. Character of Shepherd Leadership
- Blends:
   - a. **Authority** and **leadership**
   - b. **Self-sacrifice**, **tenderness**, **intimacy**
- Follows the pattern of the **Good Shepherd** (John 10:11)
   - a. *“The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.”*

##### 6. Supporting Testimony
- **Timothy Witmer** (*The Shepherd Leader*)
   - a. *“Shepherding is at the very heart of the biblical picture of leadership.”*

---

#### **B. Shared Leadership by Elders (Plurality)**
##### 1. Biblical Foundations
- Not a new idea—**Old Testament** Israel governed by plural leadership
- NT follows a similar principle consistently

##### 2. Example of Jesus
- Jesus did **not** appoint a singular human leader
- He trained and commissioned **twelve apostles**
   - a. All equally apostles
   - b. No “senior apostle with assistants”
   - c. Apostolic leadership was **shared and collaborative**
   - d. This is the model given to the church

##### 3. Example of the Apostles
- Elders in early churches functioned as **collective councils**
- Pastoral oversight given to multiple elders per church
- **Paul’s example**:
   - a. At beginning and end of ministry
   - b. Appointed/commanded appointment of **qualified elder teams**
     - i. Acts 14:23
     - ii. Titus 1:5
- Plurality of elders = **consistent New Testament pattern**

##### 4. Theological Affirmation
- **John Murray** (Westminster Theological Seminary):
   - a. *“Plurality is written in the boldest letters in the pages of the New Testament...”*
   - b. *“Singularity bears the hallmark of despite to Christ’s institution.”*
   - → **One-man rule = contradiction of NT design**

##### 5. Equality and Functional Diversity
- All elders:
   - a. Share same **office**, **title**, **pastoral charge**
- At the same time:
   - a. Differ in **Spirit-giftedness**
   - b. **Life experience**
   - c. **Availability**
   - d. **Verbal/teaching abilities**
   - e. **Biblical knowledge**

###### a. Scriptural Support for Diversity without Hierarchy
- **1 Tim. 5:17–18**
   - i. *“Elders who rule well…”*
   - ii. *“…especially those who labor in preaching and teaching”*
   - iii. *“Double honor” = financial support and esteem*
- This creates **functional diversity**, not a formal hierarchy

###### b. Practical Implications
- Some elders serve part-time, others full-time
- Model seen also in the apostolic circle:
   - i. Peter, James, John stand out in leadership
   - ii. Yet all twelve equally apostles

###### c. Further Development
- Full exposition of parity/diversity in **Chapter 3**

---

#### **C. Qualified Leadership by Elders**

   - b. Doctrinal instability
   - c. Internal division

### **Putting Things in Perspective**

#### **A. Purpose of the Section**
- To **contextualize** the plural-elder-led model within the broader Christian landscape of church government
- To contrast **competing ecclesiological models**
- To establish the **biblical superiority and textual support** of biblical eldership

---

#### **B. Overview of Five Major Views of Church Government**
> Source: *Perspectives on Church Government: Five Views of Church Polity*, ed. Chad O. Brand & R. Stanton Norman

##### 1. **Single-Elder-Led Church**
- **Polity**: Congregational
- One elder leads the congregation
- Emphasis on **local church autonomy**

##### 2. **Presbytery-Led Church**
- **Polity**: Presbyterian
- Authority lies with a **regional body of elders** (presbytery)
- Local church submits to **broader ecclesiastical courts**

##### 3. **Congregation-Led Church**
- **Polity**: Congregational
- **Final authority rests with the members**
- Elders/pastors may lead, but decisions are **congregation-driven**

##### 4. **Bishop-Led Church**
- **Polity**: Episcopal or Anglican
- Authority concentrated in **bishops**
- Hierarchical structure: bishop → priest → deacon

##### 5. **Plural-Elder-Led Church**
- **Polity**: Biblical eldership
- Leadership by **a team of scripturally qualified elders**
- View taught and defended in *Biblical Eldership*
- **Least known/practiced**, often rejected as radical
- Yet **most deeply embedded** in the language and theology of Scripture

---

#### **C. Scriptural Foundation of Plural-Elder-Led Church**
##### 1. Unique Biblical Grounding
- *No other polity* receives as much direct scriptural support
- **Eight core didactic passages** form the backbone of NT eldership doctrine:

###### a. The Eight Central Didactic Texts
1. **Acts 14:23** – Appointment of elders in every church
2. **Acts 20:17–38** – Paul's final charge to the Ephesian elders
3. **Philippians 1:1** – Addressed to overseers and deacons
4. **1 Timothy 3:1–7** – Qualifications for elders
5. **1 Timothy 5:17–25** – Honor, accusations, discipline of elders
6. **Titus 1:5–9** – Elders’ appointment and qualifications
7. **James 5:14–15** – Call the elders to pray for the sick
8. **1 Peter 5:1–5** – Shepherding and conduct of elders

##### 2. Proper Hermeneutical Principle
- Clear, central, didactic texts take precedence over unclear or obscure ones
- These eight texts = **clear and central**
- Must form the **starting point** for a doctrine of church government

---

#### **D. Theological Resistance and Institutional Rejection**
##### 1. Personal Testimony from the Author
- Experience in **seminary** revealed institutional bias:
   - a. Elder-led church idea **mocked**, called impractical
   - b. **Professors rejected** the value of numerous Scripture texts on elders
   - c. Author’s seminary professor:
     - i. “Having numerous texts on eldership means nothing!”
   - d. Implied contrast: reliance on **tradition over text**

##### 2. Widespread Hermeneutical Failure
- **Abandonment of basic interpretive principles**:
   - a. Priority of clear, didactic texts
   - b. Elevation of **secondary**, **unclear** passages
- Result:
   - a. **Biblical eldership is ignored** or
   - b. **Reinterpreted to fit denominational structures**

---

#### **E. Doctrinal and Practical Implications**
##### 1. Author’s Growing Conviction
- Opposition confirmed the **validity and urgency** of biblical eldership
- Most churches:
   - a. **Ignore**, **misapply**, or **reinterpret** eldership
   - b. Follow **tradition**, not text

##### 2. Goal of the Book
- To help the church **recover and obey** the biblical pattern
- Leadership by a **body of scripturally qualified, Spirit-appointed elders**

##### 3. Supporting Summary – **Albert N. Martin**
- *“The normal biblical framework of oversight is a plurality of scripturally qualified overseers laboring together with genuine parity and realistic, harmonious, functional diversity.”*

---

#### **F. God’s Glory in Biblical Restoration**
- God is honored when:
   - a. His people **recover long-disregarded truths**
   - b. They **renew obedience** to Scripture
   - c. They reject **cultural or institutional inertia** in favor of biblical design

---

#### **G. Transition to Jesus’s Model of Leadership**
> Before continuing the study of eldership, attention must be given to the **unique leadership teachings of Jesus Christ**

##### 1. Core Leadership Virtues Taught by Jesus
- **Humility**
- **Servanthood**
- **Brotherly equality**
- **Christlike love**

##### 2. Description
- Commonly referred to as: **“Servant Leadership”**

##### 3. Relevance
- Forms the **foundation** for understanding:
   - a. Christian leadership
   - b. How elders are to function as a team
- Serves as the **next subject** of exploration in the book

## **RESTORING NEW TESTAMENT ELDERSHIP**

---

### *Chapter 1* | New Principles for Leadership

#### _
- John 13:14–15 – “If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet…”
- The Gospels present Jesus as:
  - Perfectly perfect
    - Sinless
    - Without flaw or blemish
    - Perfectly obedient
  - Jesus as the only perfect teacher:
  - Titled “Faithful and True” and “The Word of God” (Rev. 19:11, 13)
    - Matt. 23:8, 10 – “You have one teacher… one instructor, the Christ”
    - Matt. 28:19–20 – Disciples commanded to teach only what Jesus taught
  - People’s reaction to Jesus’s teaching:
  - Mark 1:27 – “A new teaching with authority!”
    - Matt. 9:17 – New wine into fresh wineskins
  - Revolutionary teachings on leadership:
  - Inverted pyramid: leaders serve those below
    - Leadership entails:
      - Humility
        - Servanthood
        - Brotherhood
        - Christlike love
    - Jesus:
  - Denounced religious teachers’ abuse of authority
    - Prohibited authoritarianism: “Not so with you” (Luke 22:26)
    - Gave example of plurality leadership via the Twelve

#### The Training of the Twelve
- Jesus deliberately trained a **team** of twelve
- A. B. Bruce, _The Training of the Twelve_:
  - Training the twelve was of “supreme importance”
    - Principal part of Jesus’s ministry
    - Ensured permanent influence of Christ’s teaching
  - Not one ruler, but a **plurality**
  - Joint leadership
    - Trained in principles of brotherly cooperation

#### Transforming the Hearts and Minds of the Disciples
- Disciples unprepared at time of Jesus’s departure
  - Selfish values
    - Wrong view of God’s kingdom
    - Desired power and prestige
  - Examples:
  - Argued over “greatest” (Luke 22:24)
    - Sought thrones beside Jesus
  - Jesus’s mission: transform their mindset
  - Redefined greatness and leadership
    - Essential for functioning as a team
    - Dependent on:
      - New principles
        - Power of the Holy Spirit
    - Foundation for all elder teaching:
  - Humility
    - Servanthood
    - Brotherly equality
    - Christlike love

#### 1. Humility
- Jesus’s self-description:
  - “Gentle and lowly in heart” (Matt. 11:28–30)
  - Contrast with religious leaders:
  - Prideful
    - Abusive
    - Oppressive
  - Evidence of humility:
  - Attracted all types of people
    - Children and women felt safe
    - Associated with outcasts
    - Compassionate and approachable
  - Clarification:
  - Humility ≠ weakness
    - Jesus was strong, courageous, intellectually powerful
    - True greatness = balance of strength and humility
  - Taught followers to emulate humility

##### Who Is First and Greatest? (Mark 9:33–37)
- Context:
  - Argument followed Passion prediction
  - Mark 9:35 – “If anyone would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all”
- Use of paradox:
  - Challenge to common values
    - True greatness = service, humility, self-effacement
    - Receiving a child = receiving Christ and the Father

##### Fighting for First Place (Mark 10:32–45)
- James and John request top positions (v. 37)
- Jesus contrasts their desire with his mission:
  - He must suffer and die
    - Not give thrones, but predict suffering (v. 39)
    - “The cup… you will drink…” = persecution
  - Paradox of leadership:
  - Suffering precedes glory
    - Cross before crown
    - Serving before reigning
  - Mark 10:45 – “Son of Man came not to be served but to serve…”
  - Ultimate expression of servant-leadership

#### 2. Humble Servanthood
- Jesus washes disciples’ feet (John 13:3–5, 12–15)
  - Role reversal – Teacher and Lord becomes servant
  - Message:
  - Leaders must serve
    - Mutual care replaces power-seeking
  - Shocking cultural inversion
- Symbolism:
  - Servant’s towel over cleric’s robe
    - Basin and towel over throne
    - John Stott: true Christian leadership symbol = apron, not robe
  - John 13:17 – “Blessed are you if you do them”

##### Do Not Be Like Worldly Rulers (Luke 22:24–27)
- Another dispute over greatness
- Jesus’s rebuke:
  - “But not so with you”
    - Leader = youngest
    - Leader = servant
  - Jesus the table servant (v. 27)
  - Chose servant role voluntarily
    - Highest authority models lowest service

#### 3. Brotherly Equality
- Jesus condemns religious pride (Matt. 23:1–33)
- Issues with religious elite:
  - Greed
    - Hypocrisy
    - Status-seeking
    - Exploitation
  - Jesus’s warning (Matt. 23:1–12):
  - Avoid honorific titles
    - “You have one teacher… you are all brothers”
    - No hierarchical separation
    - True greatness = service
    - “Whoever exalts himself will be humbled…”

#### 4. Christlike Love
- John 13:34–35 – “Love one another: just as I have loved you”
- New commandment = new standard of love
  - Selfless
    - Sacrificial
    - Cross-centered
  - Warfield: “Self-sacrificing love is… the essence of the Christian life”
- Without this love:
  - Division
    - Denominationalism
    - Power struggles
  - Love necessary for unity and leadership:
  - 1 John 3:16
    - 1 Cor. 13:4–7
    - 1 Cor. 16:14 – “Let all that you do be done in love”

#### The Strongman Model of Leadership vs. The Christlike Servant Model

##### The Strongman Model
- Widespread globally
- Traits:
  - Power-hungry
    - Self-promoting
    - Manipulative
    - Dictatorial
    - Rejects shared leadership
  - Appeal:
  - People admire power
    - Desire “anointed” authoritarian leaders
  - Example: Diotrephes (3 John 9–10)
  - Self-first
    - Rejects apostolic authority
    - Spreads slander
    - Excludes others from church
    - Violates all servant-leadership principles

##### What the People Want
- Strongman popularity
  - Corinthian example (2 Cor. 11:19–21)
    - Preference for “super apostles”
    - Rejection of Paul’s humility
    - Misunderstanding of servant-leadership

#### Summary of the Servant-Leadership Model
- Doesn’t eliminate strong leadership
- Paul: lead “with zeal” (Rom. 12:8)
- Jesus taught:
  - New definitions of greatness, leadership, and life in community
    - Others-oriented leadership
    - Leadership = humble service
    - Serving insignificant ones
    - Willingness to suffer for others
    - Self-denial
    - Leading by example
    - Promoting others’ gifts
    - Brotherhood over hierarchy
    - 2 Cor. 4:5 – “Your servants for Jesus’ sake”

#### Looking Ahead
- Jesus’s teachings foundational to:
  - NT ecclesiology
    - Apostolic leadership structure
  - Biblical eldership = founded on:
  - Humility
    - Servanthood
    - Brotherly equality
    - Christlike love

---

### *Chapter 2* | Pastoral Leadership

#### _  
- Acts 20:28 (CSB) – “The Holy Spirit has appointed you [elders] as overseers, to shepherd the church of God.”  
- NT answer to who pastors the church: **elders**  
  - Not deacons, not staff  
  - All elders, not just one “head elder”  
  - Elders = Spirit-appointed, scripturally qualified overseers  
- Importance of aligning church structure with:  
  - Apostolic tasks (ch. 2)  
  - Biblical qualifications (ch. 4)  
- 2 Tim. 3:16–17 – God-breathed writings as guide  

#### Shepherd Imagery  
- Psalm 23:1 – “The Lord is my Shepherd”  
- John 10:11 – Jesus = “the good shepherd”  
- Used by Paul and Peter when addressing elders  
- Shepherd model (Derek Tidball, *Skillful Shepherds*):  
  - Intimacy  
  - Tenderness  
  - Concern  
  - Skill  
  - Hard work  
  - Suffering  
  - Love  
  - “A subtle blend of authority and care”  
  - “As much toughness as tenderness, as much courage as comfort”

#### Shepherding Work  

##### The Shepherd’s Presence  
- Highly relational model  
- John 10:5, 27 – sheep know shepherd’s voice; shepherd knows names  
- Jeramie Rinne – “he even smells like sheep”  
- Pastors must be visible and relational  
  - Greet people  
  - Learn names  
  - Engage with all age groups  
  - Be joyful  
- 1 Pet. 5:3 – “examples to the flock”  
- Example = spiritual influence  

##### Love  
- Must love the sheep  
  - Quote from Spanish shepherd: “You must love sheep.”  
- 1 Cor. 13:1–3 – Without love = nothing  
- John 13:34 – “new commandment”  
- Christlike love = essential for shepherding  
- Love brings:  
  - Joy in shepherding  
  - Meaningful ministry  
  - Warmth that covers lack of charisma  

##### Authority  
- Shepherd has rightful authority  
- Shepherd-sheep model includes:  
  - Leadership  
  - Correction  
  - Sovereignty  
  - Yielding  
- Acts 20:28 – Holy Spirit appoints  
  - Brings authority and empowerment  
- Authority always blended with care  

##### Hard Work  
- Gen. 31:40 – Shepherding = hard labor  
- Ezek. 34:2–8 – Lazy shepherd = bad shepherd  
- View of eldership:  
  - Not status/board role  
  - Pastoral labor  

##### Sacrifice  
- Eldership = constant concern for people  
- Personal sacrifices:  
  - Time  
  - Energy  
  - Emotional burden  

##### Dangerous Work  
- Protection from:  
  - Beasts  
  - Thieves  
- 1 Sam. 17:34–37 – David example  
- In some countries, shepherding = life-threatening  

##### Skill and Knowledge  
- Shepherding requires:  
  - Land/water management  
  - Feeding care  
  - Disease treatment  
  - Birthing assistance  
  - Shearing  
  - Comforting the dying  
- Timothy Laniak, *Shepherds after My Own Heart*:  
  - “Determined daily by the changing needs of the flock”  
  - Pastors = generalists  

##### Submit to and Obey  
- Heb. 13:17 – “Obey your leaders and submit to them…”  
- Elders are to:  
  - Lead by example  
  - Not lord over (1 Pet. 5:3)  
- Members = brothers and sisters, not subordinates  

#### The Four-Fold Responsibility of Shepherd Elders  

##### 1. Teaching–Feeding  
- 1 Pet. 5:2; Acts 20:28 – Shepherd the flock/church of God  
- Community identity:  
  - Worshiping  
  - Praying  
  - Sharing bread and cup  
  - Burden-bearing  
  - Loving  
  - Gift-exercising  
  - Scripture-learning  
  - Encouraging  
  - Resisting sin and falsehood  
- Elders expected to:  
  - Teach sound doctrine (Titus 1:9)  
  - Rebuke error  
  - Be “able to teach” (1 Tim. 3:2)  
- 1 Tim. 5:17–18 – Double honor to those who “labor” in teaching  
- “Labor” = intensive study, prep, delivery  
- Preaching = intellectual and spiritual labor  
- Teaching Strategy:  
  - Eph. 4:12 – Equip saints  
  - Acts 20:18, 20, 27 – Paul’s example  
    - Public and private teaching  
    - “Whole counsel of God”  
    - No omission of doctrine  
  - Hos. 4:6 – “My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge”  
  - Jer. 3:15 – “Shepherds… who will feed… knowledge and understanding”  
- Promote:  
  - Audio sermons  
  - Podcasts  
  - Personal Bible reading  
- 2 Tim. 3:16–17 – Word equips believers  
- Ps. 119:37 – “Turn my eyes from worthless things”  
- True believers love the Word—feed them well  

##### 2. Protecting–Guarding–Watching Over  
- Reason: sheep = defenseless  
- Dangers:  
  - False teachers (OT/NT)  
  - Satanic lies (Eph. 6:12)  
  - Secular ideologies  
- Acts 20:28–31 – “Fierce wolves… from among your own selves”  
  - Elders must be alert  
- Tasks:  
  - Guard doctrine  
  - Vet new members  
  - Discipline sin  
  - Stop infighting  
  - Handle “bully rams” (Ezek. 34:17–22)  
- Heb. 13:17 – “Keeping watch over your souls”  
- Spiritual Alertness:  
  - Be awake, alive, engaged  
  - Acts 20:31 – “Be alert”  
  - David Gooding – “Unceasing vigilance…”  
  - Stay updated on cultural/theological threats  

##### 3. Leading–Managing–Governing  
- Shepherd leads to:  
  - Pasture  
  - Water  
  - Rest  
- Charles Jefferson:  
  - Sheep = dependent  
  - Need guidance  
- Elders =  
  - Overseers  
  - Stewards of God’s house (Titus 1:7)  
- Elders manage:  
  - People  
  - Finances  
  - Church vision and values  
  - Ministries and future leaders  
- Qualities:  
  - Courageous decision-makers  
  - Evaluative and strategic thinkers  
- 1 Tim. 5:17 – “Rule well” = worthy of double honor  
- Common problem:  
  - Elders not leading, only maintaining  
  - People want good leadership  

##### 4. Practical Care  
- James 5:14 – Call elders to pray for the sick  
- Acts 20:35 – Help the weak; give generously  
- Elders = loving fathers, not executives  
- Acts of care:  
  - Name-knowing  
  - Sick visits  
  - Bereavement care  
  - Phone check-ins  
  - Encouragement  
  - Counseling  
  - Financial aid  
- Supported by qualified deacons (Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 3:8–13)  
- Deacon tasks:  
  - Aid distribution  
  - Family support  
  - Property oversight  
  - Admin help  
- Effective deacon ministry = requires elder oversight  

#### Working a Job and Pastoring a Congregation  

##### Misconception  
- “You can’t do job, family, and pastor work” = false  
- People find time for what they love  
- Examples:  
  - Church planters  
  - Tentmakers (Acts 18:2–3)  
- Elders can contribute:  
  - Even part-time  
  - Through wisdom and life example  

##### Spiritual Laziness and Neglect  
- Problem = spiritual laziness, not time  
- Men delegate to wives or professionals  
- “Women go to church; men go to football”  

##### Spiritual Dedication  
- Biblical eldership = requires:  
  - True discipleship  
  - Matt. 6:33 – Seek first God’s kingdom  
  - Rom. 12:1–2 – Living sacrifices  
- R. Paul Stevens, *Liberating the Laity*:  
  - “Pruned life”  
  - Sacrificial lifestyle  
  - Phil. 3:14 – Prize through sacrifice  
  - Tentmakers = real contribution  

#### Working as a Team  
- Elders share responsibility  
- Can be:  
  - Full-time  
  - Part-time  
  - Quarter-time  
- Elders must guard against burnout  
- Support each other  

#### Deacons: Assistants to the Overseers  
- 1 Tim. 3:5, 8–13 – Deacons assist in practical duties  
- Tasks may include:  
  - Hospital visits  
  - Charitable management  
  - Admin and property  
- Success = requires elder guidance  
- Avoid deacon frustration via clear leadership  

#### Every-Member Ministry  
- Ministry = whole church, not just elders  
- Elders equip saints (Eph. 4:12)  
- “Body” depends on **non-leaders**  
- Delegate (Acts 6:1–7)  

#### Qualified Shepherd Elders  
- 1 Tim. 3:1 – “A noble task”  
- Requires:  
  - Noble men  
  - Godly character  
  - Real abilities  
- Ch. 4: Will explore qualifications in depth

---

### *Chapter 3* | Shared Leadership

#### _  
- Acts 14:23 – “They had appointed elders for them in every church.”  
- Author’s personal testimony of blessing in elder-team ministry  
- New Testament evidence shows **pastoral leadership = team effort**  
  - James Montgomery Boice: no example of just one elder  
- Jesus modeled plurality with the twelve apostles  
- Chapter structure:  
  1. Equality and functional diversity among apostles  
  2. Equality and functional diversity among elders  
  3. Reasons for shared leadership  
  4. Refutation of single-pastor model  

---

#### Equality and Functional Diversity Among the Twelve Apostles  

##### Equality  
- Luke 6:13 – Jesus called twelve apostles  
- Luke 9:1–6 – All received authority and commission  
- Matt. 19:28 – All sit on twelve thrones  
- Acts 6:1–7 – Twelve act as a body in decision-making  
- Acts 15:1–29 – Twelve and elders resolve doctrinal crisis  
- Eph. 2:20 – Church built on **apostles** and prophets  
- Rev. 21:14 – Foundations = “names of the twelve apostles”  
- No apostolic solo rule: Peter not elevated in rank  

##### Diversity  
- Peter, James, John – more prominent  
- Peter = natural leader, not hierarchical superior  
- Peter strengthened by group; group more effective with him  
- Despite prominence, Peter held no exclusive title or ecclesiastical rank  
  - Not head of Jerusalem council (Acts 15)  
  - Described as “Peter” or “brother,” not “senior apostle”  
  - Lived out Jesus's teachings (Matt. 23:8–12)  

##### Model to Emulate  
- Apostles provide model of **equality + functional diversity**  
- Apostles initiated formation of **Jerusalem elders**  
- When apostles left, elders assumed leadership (Acts 21:17–25)  

##### Local Leaders, Not Apostles  
- Elders ≠ junior apostles  
- Elders = local governing body  
- Apostles = unrepeatable eyewitnesses (Acts 1:21–26)  
- Elders dependent on apostles’ teaching (Acts 2:42)  

---

#### Equality and Functional Diversity Among the Elders  

##### Equality  
- Acts 20:28 – All elders = overseers by Holy Spirit  
- Titus 1:9; 1 Tim. 3:2 – All must be able to teach and defend  
- 1 Tim. 3:10; 5:22–25 – All must meet same qualifications  
- James 5:14 – All may be called to pray over the sick  
- Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 5:17 – All share same titles  
- 1 Thess. 5:12–13; 1 Tim. 5:17, 19; Heb. 13:17 – All are to be loved, honored, obeyed  
- Roles include:  
  - Teaching, sacraments, decision-making, prayer  
  - Mutual accountability  

##### Terminological Confusion  
- False distinction: pastor vs. elder  
  - Common in churches with senior pastor + lay elders  
  - Creates rank where NT teaches parity  
- Better: all called “elders” or “pastor elders”  
- Samuel Waldron:  
  - No NT distinction in title, office, or authority among elders  

---

##### Functional Diversity  
- Equality ≠ uniformity  
- Gifts differ (1 Cor. 12:11; Rom. 12:8; Eph. 2:10)  
- 1 Tim. 5:17–18 – Not all “labor in preaching and teaching”  
- Some elders:  
  - Have full-time teaching roles  
  - Receive “double honor” (financial support)  
  - Are more publicly gifted  
- Elders differ in:  
  - Personality (Peter vs. John vs. Andrew vs. Matthew)  
  - Skill sets (visionary, scholar, organizer, etc.)  
- Eldership allows use of gifts **without undermining council**  
  - Council keeps all elders **accountable**  
  - Teaching does not mean sole authority  
- Leaders among leaders  
  - “First among equals” = prominence, not authority  
  - OT example: leaders of thousands, hundreds, fifties  
- Jealousy must be guarded against (1 Cor. 3:3; Prov. 27:4)  

##### No Formal Hierarchy  
- Functional roles ≠ official hierarchy  
- John Murray:  
  - Parity is coequal with plurality  
  - “There is not the slightest evidence” of hierarchy in NT eldership  
- 1 Cor. 12:4–11 – Spirit distributes gifts as He wills  
  - Public and private gifts  
  - Communicative and service-based gifts  
  - Gifts of leadership (Rom. 12:8; Eph. 4:11–12)  
- Gifted teachers must not undermine eldership’s authority  
- Council = final authority, not one gifted individual  

---

#### Reasons for Leadership by Multiple Elders  

##### 1. Human Fallenness Requires Accountability  
- Jer. 17:9 – “The heart is deceitful…”  
- Eldership = **accountability between equals**  
- Prevents autocracy, laziness, imbalance  
- Partnership = mutual growth  
  - Jesus sent disciples out **two by two**  

##### 2. Church = Spiritual Family  
- NT emphasizes:  
  - Brotherhood  
  - Mutual respect  
  - Lack of titles, clothes, status  
- Eldership structure fits **family-like community**  
- Any qualified brother may serve  

##### 3. Shared Labor  
- Distributes emotional, spiritual burdens  
- Crisis response = not one man’s job  
- Eccl. 4:9–12 – “Two are better than one…”  
- Elders pastor **one another**  
  - Bruce Stabbert: “pastors for each pastor”  

##### 4. Balance for Personal Faults  
- Blind spots, eccentricities, ego  
- Complementary strengths = full picture  
- Prov. 15:22; 24:6; 11:14 – safety in counsel  
- Elders together offer wisdom, not just one leader  

##### 5. Christ’s Presence with Two or More  
- Matt. 18:20 – Christ present with **two or three**  
- Christ is always among His church  
- Eldership reflects **Christ-centered governance**  

---

#### Faulty Examples of One-Pastor Rule  

##### Apostolic Delegates ≠ Local Pastors  
- Timothy = evangelist, apostolic envoy  
  - Worked under Paul’s direction  
- Epaphras = missionary evangelist  
  - No evidence of solo leadership in Colossae  
- James = apostle to the Jews, prominent in Jerusalem  
  - “Pillar” not “the pillar”  

##### Angels of the Churches (Rev. 1–3)  
- Symbolic, not pastors  
- “Stars = angels,” not human leaders  
- Grant Osborne: “angel” = always heavenly being in Revelation  
- Even if human: says nothing of singular authority  

##### Moses Model  
- OT model = not for NT church  
- Moses = unique, non-transferable role  
- Ignores direct NT instruction on plurality  
- Fails to account for:  
  - Acts 14:23  
  - 1 Peter 5:1–5  
  - 1 Tim. 5:17–18  

##### One Elder Per House Church  
- No NT evidence for 1 elder/house church  
- Claims are speculative: “we may suppose…”  
- Wayne Grudem: “stands in same category as… elders being blind in one eye”  
- Acts 14:23, 20:17; James 5:14 – Elders **plural**, church **singular**  
- Hebrews 13:17 – “Leaders” plural, even in house churches  

##### One Pastor-Teacher (Eph. 4:11)  
- “Shepherds and teachers” = **plural**  
- Daniel Wallace:  
  - Shepherds ⊂ teachers  
  - Not identical or two separate gifts  
- Not all elders = gifted shepherds/teachers  
- Not all shepherds = elders  
- Gifted elders = enhance team ministry, not dominate  

---

#### Closing Thoughts  

##### Core Hermeneutic Principle  
- Build doctrine on **clear, didactic texts**  
- Not on speculative, unclear, peripheral ones  
- Texts supporting plural eldership:  
  - Acts 14:23; 20:17–38  
  - Phil. 1:1  
  - 1 Tim. 3:1–7; 5:17–25  
  - Titus 1:5–9  
  - James 5:14–15  
  - 1 Peter 5:1–5  

##### Prominent Gifted Leaders ≠ Eldership Structure  
- Many gifted men in NT:  
  - 2 Cor. 8:18 – famous preacher  
  - Acts 18:24 – Apollos  
  - Col. 4:12 – Epaphras  
  - Luke, Barnabas, Aquila/Priscilla  
- May or may not be elders  
- Elders may call upon their gifts  

##### Ordinary People Build the Church  
- Unknown saints = heroes of the church  
- Eph. 2:10; 4:1–16 – body built by many, not one  
- God uses **common people** to build the Body  

##### Final Question  
- Why reject Scripture’s clear teaching on plural eldership?  
- If NT had charged senior pastors, no one would question it  
- Why undermine what is clearly stated?  
- Trust the wisdom and sufficiency of God’s word

---

### *Chapter 4* | Qualified Leadership

#### _  
- Jerome’s rebuke to Nepotian (4th century):
  - Churches focus more on ornate buildings than on qualified ministers
  - “To the choice of Christ’s ministers no heed is paid”
- Modern churches often neglect biblical qualifications
- Chapter goal:
  - Present biblical qualifications of elders
  - Preview chapters 12–14 and 20–24
  - Combine duties (chapter 2) and qualifications to define biblical eldership

---

#### The Apostolic Qualifications  
- New Testament’s overriding concern:
  - Moral and spiritual character of elders and deacons
- Church offices (eldership, deaconship):
  - Open only to those meeting biblical requirements
- Biblical eldership = biblically qualified eldership

---

#### The Qualifications as Stated in 1 Timothy 3:1–7, 10  
> *The saying is trustworthy: If anyone aspires to the office of overseer, he desires a noble task...*  
> *(1 Tim. 3:1–7)*

- Starts with internal aspiration:
  - Spirit-given desire (Acts 20:28)
  - Not under compulsion (1 Pet. 5:2)
- Desire must be matched by:
  - Godly character
  - Pastoral capability

##### Let Them Be Examined  
- Biblical mandate for public testing:
  - 1 Tim. 3:10; cf. 5:22–25
- Common church failure:
  - Appointing elders without examination
  - Leads to doctrinal or character problems
  - Often due to superficial nomination processes

---

#### The Qualifications as Stated in Titus 1:5–9  
> *This is why I left you in Crete...*  
> *(Titus 1:5–9)*

##### Elders, Overseers, and Stewards  
- Terms used:
  - **Presbyteroi (πρεσβύτεροι)** – elders
    - Conveys maturity, dignity, community respect
  - **Episkopos (ἐπίσκοπος)** – overseers
    - Conveys responsibility, supervision, management
  - **Oikonomos (οἰκονόμος)** – God’s steward
    - Overseer is steward over God’s household
    - Must be competent, trustworthy, above reproach

---

#### The Qualifications as Stated in 1 Peter 5:1–5  
> *So I exhort the elders among you...*  
> *(1 Pet. 5:1–5)*

- Three terms used:
  - “Elders” (noun)
  - “Shepherd” (verb)
  - “Exercising oversight” (verb)
- Peter’s emphasis:
  - Elders’ motives and attitudes in shepherding
  - Christ-centered reward: “unfading crown of glory”

---

#### Reasons for the Qualifications  
- Elders are:
  - God’s stewards over His family (Titus 1:7)
  - Guardians of the gospel message
- Therefore must be:
  - Spiritually, ethically mature
  - Competent in managing and teaching
- Elders must be examples (1 Pet. 5:3)
- Charles Spurgeon:
  - “A man’s life is always more forcible than his speech…”
  - Practice overrides preaching in influence

---

#### Qualifications for All Elders  
- No distinction between:
  - “Ordained clergy” vs. “lay elders”
- Only two church offices:
  - Elders/Overseers
  - Deacons
- All elders must meet same biblical qualifications

---

#### The Right Temperament for Shepherd Leadership  

##### Household Management  
- Elder = faithful husband
- Respected father
- Proves himself in household management
- Parallel between family and church (1 Tim. 3:4–5)

##### Self-Control & Integrity  
- Self-control in:
  - Money
  - Alcohol
  - Authority
- Displays:
  - Financial and doctrinal integrity
  - Fairness, uprightness, good reputation

##### Relational Skills  
- Cannot be:
  - Arrogant
  - Quarrelsome
  - Quick-tempered
  - Violent
  - Domineering
- Must be:
  - Hospitable
  - Helpful
  - Gentle
  - Lover of the Word
  - Joyful in teaching

---

#### Character Trumps Giftedness  
- Structure alone doesn’t ensure healthy leadership
- Leadership requires:
  - Godly character over charisma
  - “Just,” “devout,” “self-controlled,” “faithful”
- Al Mohler:
  - “Character is indispensable to credibility”
- Biblical leadership = character-based credibility

---

#### Not Perfection or Sinlessness  
- Bible presents flawed leaders
- Qualifications ≠ perfection
- Elders have:
  - Weaknesses, blind spots, inconsistencies
- Wisdom needed in evaluation

##### Example: “Self-Control”  
- Not absolute
- Varies in degree and by culture
- Must be assessed contextually and realistically

---

#### Leadership Training  
- Candidates can improve:
  - Through discipleship
  - Through doctrinal teaching
- Mentoring & education help meet biblical standards

##### Plan Now for the Future  
- Rising difficulty due to:
  - Secularism
  - Moral decay
- Urgent need:
  - Discipling youth for future eldership

---

#### Fully Committed to Apostolic Doctrine  
> *He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught...*  
> *(Titus 1:9)*

- “Trustworthy word” = gospel of Jesus Christ
- “As taught” = apostolic writings (Scripture)
- Must:
  - Adhere to apostolic teaching
  - Reject theological risk-taking
  - Be reliable model of doctrinal fidelity

---

#### Able to Instruct and Defend Sound Doctrine  
> *...so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it.*  
> *(Titus 1:9)*

- Requirements:
  - Years of study
  - Reasoned understanding
  - Logical communication
- Elders must:
  - Articulate church beliefs
  - Defend truth
  - Instruct congregation

##### Each Elder:
- Different levels of skill
- None should be:
  - A novice
  - Biblically ignorant

##### Dual Role:
- **Teacher** – builds up
- **Guardian** – protects doctrine

---

### *Chapter 5* | Male Leadership 

#### _  
- Biblical eldership is plainly taught, yet often rejected due to:
  - Preference for senior-pastor model
  - Clergy-laity tradition
  - Objection to all-male eldership
- Biblical eldership **is an all-male eldership**
- Common objections:
  - Viewed as sexist or discriminatory
  - Pain of past abuse toward women acknowledged
  - Discrimination is a grievous sin

---

#### Binding Biblical Authority  
- Christians are under God-breathed Scripture (2 Tim. 3:16–17)
- God’s design revealed in:
  - Gen. 1:26–2:25 (Creation)
  - Eph. 5:21–33 (Redemptive order after the Fall)
- Creation: Male and female both bear the image of God (Gen. 1:26–28)
- Gender role distinctions:
  - Designed by God
  - To be embraced, not erased

> John Piper: “Manhood and womanhood are the beautiful handiwork of a good and loving God.”

---

#### Jesus and the Apostles  
##### The Male Jesus  
- Born male by Spirit (Matt. 1:18; Luke 1:35)
- Theologically necessary:
  - Seed of woman (Gen. 3:15)
  - Bridegroom of the church (Rev. 21)
  - Counterpart to Adam (1 Cor. 15:45, 47)
  - Last Adam; Second man

##### Twelve Male Apostles  
- Chosen after night of prayer (Luke 6:12–16)
- Appointed by divine guidance, not cultural accommodation
- Feminist claim: Jesus conceded to patriarchy
- Refuted:
  - Jesus openly rebuked religious culture (Matt. 22:16)
  - Not a coward or male chauvinist
  - Women welcomed, respected, and present (e.g., Mark 10:13–16)
  - Yet none were chosen as apostles

---

#### Paul and the Qualifications for Elders/Overseers  
##### Context: 1 Timothy 2:8–15 precedes 3:1–13  
- Women instructed:
  - To dress modestly (v. 9)
  - To focus on godliness and good works (v. 10)
  - Not to teach or exercise authority over men (vv. 12–14)
- Elder qualifications assume male subject:
  - “Husband of one wife” (1 Tim. 3:2)
  - Manages “his own household” (1 Tim. 3:4)
- Elders teach and lead (1 Tim. 5:17), which women are not permitted to do (2:12)
- Biblical structure for “household of God” (1 Tim. 3:15)

> “I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man” — 1 Tim. 2:12

##### Greek Word: αὐθεντέω (authenteō)  
- Meaning: “to have authority over”
- Does **not** mean:
  - “Usurp authority”
  - “Instigate violence”
  - “Misuse authority”
- Supported by: *Women in the Church*, ed. Köstenberger & Schreiner

---

#### Gifted Women  
- Women have spiritual gifts:
  - Can teach, lead, serve (Acts 16:14; Rom. 16:1–15; Phil. 4:2–3)
- Roles exercised without violating male leadership

---

#### The Original Creation Order Designed by God  
> *Adam was formed first, then Eve…* — 1 Tim. 2:13–14  
- Paul grounds argument in Genesis:
  - Not culture, education, or heresy
  - God’s creation mandate (Gen. 1:27–28)

> Kevin DeYoung: “To ignore…differences is to reject our creational design.”

##### Apostolic Arguments for Headship  
1. Creation laws (1 Tim. 2:13–14; 1 Cor. 11:7–12)  
2. Universal church practice (1 Cor. 11:16; 14:36–38)  
3. Order in the Godhead (1 Cor. 11:3)  
4. Command of Jesus (1 Cor. 14:37)  
5. Christ–Church analogy (Eph. 5:23–27)  

> Intent: Permanent, universal, not cultural

---

#### Harmony with Other Scriptural Texts  
- Consistent with:
  - 1 Cor. 11:2–16; 14:33–38
  - Eph. 5:22–33
  - Col. 3:18–19
  - Titus 2:4–5
  - 1 Pet. 3:1–7
- Secular feminists:
  - Reject Scripture entirely
  - View distinctions as irredeemably patriarchal

---

#### Husbands’ and Wives’ Complementary Roles in Marriage  
> *For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church…* — Eph. 5:23–27  

##### Like Christ  
- Male headship is not cultural
- Based on:
  - Christ’s headship of the Church
  - Sacrificial love (v. 25)

##### Like the Church  
- Female submission:
  - Mirrors church’s submission to Christ
  - Not slavery or abuse

##### Marriage–Church Parallel  
- Ephesians 5 = marriage roles  
- 1 Timothy 2 = church roles

> “The church community must be structured in a way that supports the pattern of the family…”

---

#### Who Really Is Accommodating the Culture?  
- Scriptural view held for thousands of years
- Post-1960s secular influence changed views
- Many Christians now:
  - Reject biblical distinctions under cultural pressure
- Takes deep conviction to stand against culture

---

#### Twisting the Scriptures  
- Evangelical feminism undermines authority of Scripture
- Tactics:
  - Label texts as “obscure,” “temporary,” or “problematic”
  - Use Gal. 3:28 to override headship texts
- Consequences:
  - Bible appears to contradict itself
  - Undermines trust in Scripture

---

#### Women Gifted for Ministry  
- New Testament support:
  - Acts 1:14; Rom. 16; 1 Tim. 2; Titus 2
- Women should:
  - Serve with spiritual gifts (1 Cor. 7:34; Acts 16:15)
  - Study Scripture and instruct (1 Tim. 2:11; Acts 18:26)
  - Evangelize (Phil. 4:2–3)
  - Engage in mercy ministry (Acts 9:36, 39)
  - Serve church (Rom. 16:1, 6)
  - Teach domestic wisdom (Titus 2:4–5)
  - Show hospitality (Acts 16:15)
  - Pray and prophesy (1 Cor. 11:5)
  - Care for home (1 Tim. 5:10, 14)

> Principle of male headship does not diminish the value of women's ministry

---

#### Jesus and Women  
- No one honored women more than Jesus
- Women:
  - Ministered to him (Luke 8:3)
  - Were present at the cross (Matt. 27:55–56)
  - First to witness resurrection (Matt. 28:5–7)
- Yet:
  - Jesus did not appoint women as apostles or elders
  - Upheld creation design (Matt. 19:3–9; Gen. 1:26–2:25)
